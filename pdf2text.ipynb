It runs a comparison between the three villages and shows that there is a positive relationship between rainfall shortage and out-migration, after taking other important demographic and socioeconomic factors into account, such as age, wealth and education.

       "  'Introduction': \"Climate variability refers to a deviation from the long-term meteorological average over a certain period of time. Most simulations predict exacerbated variability and increasing extreme weather events as a result of global warming (IPCC, 2001). Droughts or floods are examples of extreme weather events categorized under climate variability. Generally, such events are characterized by their severe effects on people's livelihoods, especially on agricultural production and associated food security. Food security 'exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life' (FAO, 2002b).\\nSince the 1980s, several studies have been linking climatic and environmental changes to human migration. It is difficult to find an environmental migrant per se, as there are various economic, political, social and cultural push and pull factors that influence the migration decision alongside environmental issues (see, for example, Afifi & Ja ¨ger, 2010;Warner, Erhart, de Sherbinin, Adamo, & Onn, 2009).\\nPrevious studies attempted to assess the effect of climate change and environmental problems on human migration. Empirical research has been conducted within the Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-FOR) project (Ja ¨ger, Fru ¨hmann, Gu ¨nberger, & Vag, 2009) and a UNHCR Horn of Africa study (Afifi, Govil, Sakdapolrak, & Warner, 2012). These studies contributed to the literature with broad knowledge about the effect of climatic/environmental problems on human mobility. The Foresight Report ( 2011) is a meta-study that combines the literature and the existing empirical work on the topic in one document.\\nThis article, however, addresses the interrelation between a specific climatic factor, namely rainfall variability, on one hand, and food insecurity and human mobility, on the other. The research is applied on three villages in the Same District, Kilimanjaro, located in north-east Tanzania (see Map 1), on the borders with Kenya.\\nTanzania's long-term economic growth is dependent on natural resources. Agriculture makes up more than half of the gross domestic product and employs about 80% of its labour force (Tanzania Invest, 2012). About 95% of the agricultural sector is rain-fed and subsistence based (HBS, 2007). Therefore, the effect that climate variability has on predominantly rain-fed agrarian economies might clearly be demonstrated by Tanzania (Van Aalst, Hellmuth, & Ponzi, 2007). The majority of rural households suffer from either chronic or transitory food insecurity. The National Environmental Policy (NEP, 1997) identifies deforestation and land degradation as the second and third most urgent problems out of six that require attention, respectively.\\nThe main research objective of this article is to identify the circumstances under which households in the villages # 2013 The Author(s).

Non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly attributed, cited, and is not altered, transformed, or built upon in any way, is permitted. The moral rights of the named author(s) have been asserted. Bangalala, Ruvu Mferejini and Vudee use migration as a risk management strategy in response to rainfall variability and associated food insecurity. To do so, the following questions are addressed:\\n(1) To what extent are the households of the study affected by rainfall variability? (2) What are the top environmental, social, economic and other factors that influence migration in the three villages? (3) What role does the rainfall in association with elevation in the three villages of research play in out-migration?\\nThe article argues that rainfall variability affects human mobility, and highlights that the link between both variables is represented in food insecurity for humans and their livestock. It runs a comparison between the three villages with distinct elevations and associated rainfall differences, and shows that there is a positive relationship between rain shortage and out-migration, taking other socio-economic factors into account.\\nThe article introduces the research site and its characteristics; analyses the observations made in the field on the main three variables (rainfall variability, livelihood/ food insecurity and migration); and concludes and provides some policy recommendations. It is important to mention the research limitations briefly, for these to be considered/avoided in future research. The main challenges were the lack of follow-up with the same communities over a particular period of time, interviewing communities in the areas of origin rather than destination, the short time of field research (4 weeks), the small geographical coverage and the incomprehensiveness of meteorological data (Liwenga, Kwezi, & Afifi, 2012).\",\n",
       "  'Research methods': 'The study involves a mixed-method approach which combines expert interviews (government officials, Environmental and migration scholars, meteorological specialists and NGO representatives), a household survey of 165 households (stratified sampling by wealth ranking) and Participatory Research Approach (PRA) sessions with the communities (Rademacher-Schulz et al., 2012;Afifi & Warner forthcoming 2014). The PRA sessions included -but were not limited to -Focus Group Discussions (to allow for open discussions about various issues of research interest), seasonality calendars (to address issues related to seasonal rainfall), timeline and trend analysis (to detect the good and bad years and months in terms of rainfall and link that with food insecurity and migration patterns), risk ranking (to understand the threats the communities are facing and the way how they cope with and adapt to them), Venn diagrams (to get information about the institutions and individuals that play a role in securing food availability for the communities) and mobility maps (to find out the areas of destinations the communities reach when migrating). There were separate PRA sessions for women, men, elderly, farmers, non-farmers and marginalized separately, but there were also heterogeneous and mixed sessions with diverse characteristics. The household survey included questions directly and indirectly related to the three main variables of the study, namely rainfall variability, food (in)security and human mobility. Moreover, national meteorological data are considered in the study. However, a research limitation related to that is the lack of data that link the weather changes to migration flows in the research site. Therefore, there was a great reliance on the household survey and the PRA methods.',\n",
       "  'Research site characteristics': \"The three research villages Bangalala, Ruvu Mferejini and Vudee (see Map 1) are located in the south Pare Mountains, which form part of the Pangani River Basin, where the climate ranges from semi-arid to dry sub-humid, and the rainfall pattern is bimodal with a 'short' rain season called Vuli (October to January) and a 'long' rain season (February to May) called Masika (see Figure 1). 1\",\n",
       "  'Ethnic composition of the communities': 'In Bangalala and Vudee, the majority of the population interviewed belongs to the ethnic group Pare. Ruvu Mferejini is a more dynamic and mixed community which includes the Masai pastoral community that resides in the area dependent on water availability from the Pangani River for their livestock. ',\n",
       "  'Economic activities and income sources': 'In the three research villages, agriculture is the main economic activity (58% of the surveyed households in Vudee, 57.7% in Bangalala and 52.4% in Ruvu Mferejini). Nevertheless, activities related to livestock are minimal in Vudee as a highland (7%) as compared with Bangalala (23.7%) and Ruvu Mferejini (42.9%) (see Figures 234). Vudee has the most income diversification (which corresponds to the highest average years of schooling of the work force) relative to the two other villages.',\n",
       "  'Overall rainfall patterns': 'In the research site, the rainfall patterns and their distribution across rain seasons and years have become variable during the past two to three decades (Enfors & Gordon, 2007). Although the rain is usually of high intensity, it falls over a short period of time, which makes the water drain into the river networks and alluvial aquifers (Mul et al., 2011) and contributes to erosion before reaching the main rivers. This has negative implications for the production of the typical food crops, such as maize and beans (Mutiro, Makurira, Senzanje, & Mul, 2006). Therefore, the rainfall variability negatively influences food security of the communities in the three villages. In general, Bangalala (midland -900 m.a.s.l.) and Ruvu Mferejini (lowland -655 m.a.s.l.) are subject to less rain as compared with Vudee (highland -1950 a.s.l.). The average annual precipitation in the research area ranges from 500 to about 1000 mm (Enfors & Gordon, 2007).\\nA scoping study prior to the field research revealed that farmers in Bangalala generally suffer from rain shortage and consequent low crop production. In 2008, Bangalala suffered from an intense drought. Vudee, the village with the highest elevation among the three research villages has also suffered from erratic rainfall that led to crop failure.',\n",
       "  'Traditional adaptation strategies to rainfall variability': 'Although seasonal migration is a typical adaptation strategy for the community in Vudee, some members of the community migrated for long periods or permanently due to severe droughts from 1998 to 2005. As for Ruvu Mferejini, in contrast to the two other villages, farming depends on both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture due to the naturally scarce rainfall, but there are also pastoralists and fishermen. In order for the communities to have a regular and daily source of irrigation water, they rely to a great extent on the traditional Ndivas (water ponds) where the water is stored.   ',\n",
       "  'Field research findings': \"Table 1 shows the socio-demographic and economic profiles that resulted from the household survey across the three research villages. Almost half of the farmers are on the medium scale (49%) in terms of land ownership. Ruvu Mferejini has the highest percentage of large farmers' households in contrast to Vudee that has the highest percentage of small and landless farmers' households. Bangalala stands in between (see also average landholding in same table). This suggests that the elevation could play an important role. The communities in the lowlands might have better access to other villages/cities and more mobility. That makes them generate more income (especially regarding livestock business) as compared with the communities in the highlands (highest average farm landholding is in Ruvu Mferejini -2.11 ha as in shown in Table 1).\",\n",
       "  'Rainfall': 'According to the experts from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) (Personal communication during Expert Interviews, 14 March 2012), the total amount of annual rainfall has not decreased significantly throughout the past three decades (see Figure 5). Nevertheless, the annual rainfall data do not necessarily reflect its distribution and intensity, since large amounts of rain fall in only limited number of days, resulted in crop failure. Since the mideighties, the communities have been under longer and more frequent droughts, dry spells within the rain seasons, delayed rain season onsets, earlier rain season cessations and shorter rain seasons than expected; Figure 6 shows the decrease of the total rainy days per annum over the past five decades. Based on the TMA information, the five extreme lowest rainfall events in the district occurred in the years 1952 (314.04), 1975 (320.10), 1993 (302.40), 1996 (318.30) and 2005 (265.30) (mm/annual).\\nThe experts also highlighted the increasing temperature that leads to more evaporation of the reserved water in the traditional Ndivas. This was confirmed by the PRA participants (even in Vudee where the temperature used to be much milder due to its location in the highlands) who reported further that the winds enhanced by the lack of a sufficient vegetal cover often harm the crops before they enter the pollination phase.\\nThe PRA participants in the three research villages reported that in the past 10-15 years, the rains have started later and ended earlier than before in the two rain seasons (confirmed by 68% of households) and have been often interrupted by unexpected long dry spells (confirmed by 84% of households), which made it difficult for the farmers to plan. The household survey reveals that more than 80% of the economies of the households surveyed suffer from rainfall variability.',\n",
       "  'Livelihood and food security': 'The principal crop of subsistence in the site is maize with an average harvest just above 1 ton/ha (FAO, 2008a) and  a The interviewee representing each household was the head. In case the latter was absent, the next representative (usually the wife) who had to be grown up and who knew most of the issues within the household was interviewed. b Three households did not specify the size of their land in numbers, but the interviewer has recorded the category as described by the interviewees (small, medium and large).\\nvegetables are the principal cash crops sold at the Same market. Other food crops include lablab, cowpeas, beans, sweet potatoes and onions. The experts stated that the main challenge facing the communities is the occurrence of droughts that aggravate many problems affecting livelihood and food security in the research site as well as in other areas according to the dependence on agriculture and farming activities.\\nThe household survey -considering all three communities together -indicates that the percentage of people engaged in agricultural activities and farming has increased by 30.9% and livestock keeping by 18.8% throughout the past 10 years. This means that farming and livestock keeping have become more significant. As the focus on farming and livestock increased, the overall in situ livelihood diversification decreased. For example, there has been a slight decrease in the percentage of households engaged in casual daily labour by around 2.4% and the reliance on remittances have increased by 4.2% during the same period. This suggests decrease in local employment and increase in the employment of migrants in their destination communities.\\nAmong the most important threats to livelihood facing the communities according to the PRA sessions across the three research villages was rainfall variability (increase in drought incidences, seasonal shifts and prolonged dry spells) and water shortage in the traditional Ndivas. Drought took the first rank in terms of severity. These PRA findings were supported by the household survey that identified drought to be affecting 94% of the households, followed by storms and winds (29.1%).\\nRegarding food insecurity, food production has decreased over the past two decades. Rainfall variability affected the economy of 82.4% of the surveyed households and 82% have particularly suffered from decreasing income due to declining yields.\\nSince the climatic and rainfall changes have affected crop production and livestock activities, and thus, the livelihood of the communities, the latter have developed various coping strategies. The relatively wealthy groups tend to store food for future use. The medium groups apply the coping strategies of livelihood diversification, such as casual labouring for payment in food or cash. The activities include firewood sales, charcoal making, brick-making, selling livestock, seeking labour opportunities outside the villages or sending their children for labouring opportunities. Some also migrate to areas with better pastures and more water availability. The poor change their food intake, such as eating more wild edible products or reducing the number of meals or food types they consume; they also seek support from others in the community and government food aid or borrow food from wealthier households. As shown in Table 1, the wealth groups in the household survey were listed according to land ownership (small and landless farmers: own 0.004 -0.71 ha; medium farmers: own 0.712 -1.62 ha; large farmers: own more than 1.624 ha). Other factors considered for wealth ranking were the amount of livestock a  household owns (cattle, goats and/or sheep); the size of farmland a household owns; amount of food consumed; the number and type of houses the household owns; the number of assets a household possesses (cars, milling machines, radios, etc.); and the amount of money the household owns at the time of the interview.',\n",
       "  'Migration': \"The migration profile extracted from the household survey shows that the households with migrants in the research villages make up 54% of the total number. Ruvu Mferejini has the highest percentage (59%), followed by Bangalala (53%) and Vudee (49%) (Table 1). Elevation could play an important role in the migration decision; the lower the people are located, the more they have access to the surrounding communities. Ruvu Mferejini's reliance on agriculture and livestock rearing, and its difficulties with drought, also make migration a prominent consideration. Moreover, rain abundance in the highland (Vudee) may be another factor that increases the incentive to stay in the home community compared with the lowlands. In addition, as Vudee has the least amount of households whose activities are related to livestock, its inhabitants are less sensitive to rainfall variability.\\nIn general, seasonal migration (less than 6 months) makes up 53.4% versus temporal migration (more than 6 months) that makes up 46.6%. This indicates the reliance of the communities on agriculture and the associated seasonal conditions. The household survey further reveals that the number of economic migrants is twice as large as the number of educational migrants, which means that most people migrate in an attempt to immediately improve their livelihood, with a smaller group migrating as an investment in their future. Categorizing the migrants into landless, small, medium and large farmers, the average number of migrants per household is highest among the large farmers (2.46), followed by the landless (1.18), then the medium (1.06) and small farmers (0.65). From a logical point of view, one would expect that the poorer and less food secure would migrate more in order to improve their livelihoods. However, it is usually the large farmers who possess sufficient means to leave, and their migration decision might not necessarily be related to food insecurity but rather pull factors in the areas of destination. The landless might have a stronger reason to migrate than the medium or small farmers, even if the former must fund their move through loans from others, in order to survive their deprivation and food insecurity. One other factor that might facilitate the migration decision for this category is that the lack of land ownership also removes responsibility and obligations which could otherwise reduce mobility. In addition, there would be no potential land disputes to concern them during their return as it might be in the case of small and medium landholders.\\nHistorically, migration has always existed in the research site, but it has increased in the past three decades and is mainly preceded by droughts. The PRA focus group discussions revealed that people do migrate in search of food, and livestock keepers have to migrate in search of pasture and water. Both decisions highly depend on the climatic conditions. For example, if the long rainy season Masika fails, people migrate mainly from May through August.\\nMoving to the factors that were listed in the household survey as 'very important' for taking a migration decision. Figure 7 shows that the increase in drought frequency predominates, followed in order by water shortage, flooding, lack of land for grazing, unreliable harvests, decline of crop production for consumption and shifted seasonal rainfalls. It seems that the interviewed household representatives do not consider the seasonal shifts to be a significant problem, as seasonal migration occurs in any case. The same figure shows that it is Ruvu Mferejini that is affected at most, which goes in line with the above observations regarding irregular rain and water shortage as compared with the other villages. In contrast, the same factors seem not to be as important in the case of Vudee, also for the same argument (relative abundance of rain in the village). What confirms this argument is that Bangalala, at a halfway mark between Ruvu and Vudee in terms of poverty, elevation, rainfall and migration, also scored the importance of the factors between the scores of the other two villages.\\nIn the PRA sessions, migration was ranked very high as a coping strategy for food insecurity across the three villages; people migrate, in a sense by following water, in order to improve their livelihoods and feed their animals. The respondents highlighted that the worst droughts were the ones that significantly disrupted their livelihood system in terms of crop and livestock production and resulted in people migrating to other locations. Furthermore, they complained about the migration strategy, even though it is broadly applied, as it results in the families and dependents being neglected for long periods.\\nMap 2 shows the location of the three research villages, the migration destinations, the average precipitation, the agricultural land and the drought frequency/rainfall variability.\",\n",
       "  'Discussion': 'The analysis above shows that the rainfall patterns and the degree of their effects on migration vary among the specific villages; the modest migration records in Vudee (highland) can be attributed to the fact that it is the wettest village rainwise (highest precipitation) and the poorest in terms of landholdings, and therefore people might lack the means for migration. At the same time, the generally generous rain gives them less reason to migrate and the higher than average level of education reduces the need for them to send their children elsewhere. Moreover, it has the highest average years of schooling and the most teachers (self sufficiency and no need for schools outside the village). The fact that Vudee has the highest number of elderly as compared with the two other research villages might also contribute to the relative immobility. On the contrary, Ruvu Mferejini (lowland) is the village with lowest precipitation and the richest in terms of landholdings. The mobility of the population in this village as compared with the two others (also see migration arrows on Map 2) could be attributed to its closeness to urban areas (search of jobs to improve livelihoodpull factors), as well as the largest representation of pastoral communities that need to feed their livestock and are therefore more sensitive to water availability (Ruvu Mferejini has the highest percentage of people dependent on livestock activities from the three villages). The relatively great wealth of the village might give the communities better opportunities to migrate, and at the same time, this wealth might be attributed to their access to urban centres (remittances). Bangalala (midland) lies in between regarding all these variables, including migration.',\n",
       "  'Conclusions and recommendations': 'Rainfall variability has a clear effect on food security of the communities of the three research villages, and hence, on their human mobility. More than 80% of the economies of the households surveyed have been affected by rainfall variability. Frequent droughts and water shortage are the top factors that influence migration in the overall research site. Diverse levels of elevation and precipitationamong other socio-economic factors -across the three villages of research are associated with respectively various migration patterns. In the highest, wettest and poorest village with the highest rate of education and with the oldest population age wise, out-migration is the least.\\nIt is important that the traditional Ndivas are well maintained and used on a larger scale, such that the water stored in them can be used more broadly and can provide the maximum amount of land with water for longer periods. It is also essential that the Ndiva water is economized, so that the negative effects of evaporation are mitigated. Moreover, it is crucial that the communities who prefer to stay or cannot afford to migrate receive support. Making use of the remittances in a systematic way (development projects and micro-scale investments) can support their livelihoods in situ. As to the migrants, their value added to the areas of destination should be maximized by involving them in activities that match their skills (e.g. farming and construction), so that they actively contribute to the overall welfare of the new areas on one hand and to the well-being of themselves and their families on the other.'},\n",
       " 1: {'abstract': 'We analyse whether migration is an adaptation that households employ to cope with climate in Ghana and Nigeria. If migration is part of the present adaptation portfolio of households in developing countries, it is reasonable to expect that it will also be an adaptation to future climate change. It is important to stress that we are interested in long-term climatic conditions rather than in short-term weather fluctuations. The data to test these predictions are drawn from two different household surveys: the Nigeria General Household Survey and the Ghana Living Standard Survey. We find a hill-shaped relationship between temperature in the dry season and the propensity to migrate in households that operate farms. We also find a significant hill-shaped relationship between precipitations in the wet seasons and the propensity to migrate in farm households. Climate has instead no significant impact on the propensity to migrate in non-farm households. Climate change scenarios generated by General Circulation model reveal that, ceteris paribus, migration may decline in Ghana and in Nigeria.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"The scientific evidence that climate is changing produced a lively interest among scholars regarding the economic effects of climate change.\\nIn this paper we study how climate affects migration decisions of households in Ghana and Nigeria. If migration is part of the present adaptation portfolio of households to different climatic conditions, it is reasonable to expect that it will also be an adaptation to climate change. Thus, with this paper we also provide estimates of the expected impact of future climate change on migration in Ghana and Nigeria.\\nIt is important to stress that we are interested in climate -the average of weather conditions over a long period of time -rather than in short-term weather fluctuations, which represent single realizations of climate. Our approach thus accounts for the long-run adaptation response to climate.\\nThe existing literature has instead mainly focused on the relationship between weather variability as well as weather extreme shocks, such as flood or drought, and migration. Overall this literature finds moderate evidence that out-migration is a response to agricultural productivity losses due to harmful weather events.\\nFor example, Feng et al. (2010) find that weather shocks that reduce crop yields in Mexico increase emigration to the United States. However, Auffhammer and Vincent (2012) demonstrate that this effect vanishes if one appropriately accounts for time effects. Gray and Mueller (2012a) study the effects of flooding on individual mobility. The authors report that, despite the expectations of a positive influence, flood fails to increase mobility in Bangladesh. Lower available resources and increased labour need after the shock may explain such finding. Bohra-Mishra et al. (2014) report that weather fluctuations more than sudden climatic disasters influence household permanent migration in Indonesia. Dillon et al. (2011) find that in Nigeria the likelihood of migration increases with greater temperature variability, which proxies for ex-ante unanticipated shocks. Moreover, male migration is positively influenced by hot ex-post shocks. Mueller, Gray and Kosec (2014) find that heat stress rather than high rainfall, flooding or moisture, are responsible for migration in Pakistan.\\nIn Brazil, Mueller and Osgood (2009) find mixed results. They report that climate shocks, expressed as the deviation from the mean precipitation, encourage migration if the shock occurred one to four years prior the year of migration. On the contrary, shocks that realized in the far past, namely more than five years before, discourage emigration. The authors reconcile these mixed findings arguing that the sample of migrants is composed by households which have been pushed to migrate due to the shocks as well as by households which have been attracted by urban 2 employment opportunities. Different studies relate exposure to drought and migration. Gray and Mueller (2012b) find that drought increases men's labor migration in Ethiopia. Henry et al. (2004) for Burkina Faso report increased migration as a consequence of scarce precipitations. Barrios et al. (2006) from a macro-perspective analyse the link between average annual rainfall and urbanization rate in Sub-Saharan countries. The paper finds that a decrease in precipitation is a strong determinant of migration to urban areas. Marchiori et al. (2012) estimate that temperature and rainfall anomalies produced the displacement of 5 million people between 1960 and 2000 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Beine and Parsons (2015) on the contrary, find that neither natural disasters nor deviations and volatilities of temperatures and rainfall from their mean have a statistically significant effect on emigration in a panel of 137 origin countries. Having accounted for other determinants of emigration, including GDP, what the paper finds is that there is no direct effect of weather on emigration, by the effect of weather fully absorbed in the other (economic) controls.\\nThe analysis of migration response to weather variation and shocks is a very interesting area of research but the estimated elasticities should not be used to estimate the response to slowly changing climate patterns. Short-term responses may either overestimate or underestimate the long-run response. In the short-run households may react by implementing adaptations that are viable only in the short-term. For example farmers may implement non-sustainable management activities. In this case the short-run response is flatter than the long-run response. Alternatively, in the short-run households do not have the time to invest into adaptations that would alleviate the impact of a persistent change in weather. In this case the short-run response is steeper than the long-run response. By looking at the long-run relationship between climate and migration our goal is to provide a more accurate characterization of how climate change may alter long-run migration decisions.\\nTo our knowledge, only few papers have studied how climate affects migration. Munshi (2003) reports that low rainfall in rural Mexico is associated with larger emigration to the United States. Gray (2009) for Ecuador introduces in an individual migration regression a time-invariant value of community mean annual precipitation. While both internal and international migration are found to decrease with community precipitation, the authors report that negative environmental conditions do not necessarily increase migration.\\nIn this article we follow the spirit of the Ricardian studies of climate change impacts on agriculture (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Ricardian models assume that the long term productivity of land is reflected in agricultural land prices. By regressing land values per hectare on climate and on other control variables it is possible to estimate how climate affects the long-run productivity of agricultural land. The present sensitivity of land values to climate can be used to estimate the sensitivity of agriculture to future climate change, keeping all else fixed, in a comparative statics exercise. In this article we regress long-run migration patterns of households on climatic conditions and on other control variables. The advantage of this method is that it fully accounts for adaptation to the present climate. The set of adaptation options is large. In a rural setting, as in Ghana and Nigeria, households have adapted agriculture to local climatic conditions by selecting crops, the mix of crop and animal farming, irrigation, planting and harvesting dates. Household have also choosen the optimal mix of farm and non-farm activities to maximize their welfare. Migration is one of the many possible adaptations to local climatic conditions. The method thus identifies the relationship between climate and migration by exploiting the cross-section variation of climate and of long run migration decisions.\\nWhat is the expected shape of the relationship between climate and migration? It is reasonable to assume that with less favorable climatic conditions the incentive to migrate increases. However, migration is an expensive investment and it may be too costly for some households.\\nHigh temperatures and extreme precipitation patterns reduce agricultural productivity for many reasons. The relationship between crop productivity and average temperature and rainfall is typically hill-shaped. Farmers adapt to different climatic conditions by choosing the optimal crop mix, the growing season and the optimal mix of crops and animal activities, but at high temperature and at extremely low or high precipitation levels, the overall profitability of agriculture declines (Mendelsohn et al., 1994;Porter et al., 2014). For example, higher temperatures in the tropics reduce the size of the agro-climatic zones suitable for perennial crops (Porter et al., 2014). The migration of a family member can therefore compensate for a decrease in farming income.\\nMigration is even more attractive if adaptation possibilities are limited because of credit or information constraints (Nhemachena and Hassan, 2007). Poor farmers may lack means to pursue structural adjustments. Moreover, low levels of education can limit the possibility to adapt through technology or input switches as farmers may not be able to identify the most efficient inputs mix and the most appropriate technology to face changes in the external environment (Baez et al., 2008).\\nIt is therefore possible that farmers chose to diversify income sources, engaging some members in activities external to the family business.\\nClimate change at the low latitudes may thus well increase the incentive to migrate. However, it is important to note that migration is an investment requiring the availability of capital. Climate change may increase the incentive to migrate but, with incomplete and imperfect markets, households may not be able to migrate because they may see a reduction in the very capital required to enable a move. A worsening in the climate could be associated with a lower chances of migration. Gray (2009) labels this hypothesis as the environmental-capital hypothesis, whereby increased productivity due to better conditions provides the capital to finance costly migration. Thus, given these different channels, working in opposite direction, the relationship between climate and migration decisions deserves an empirical analysis.\\nIn this paper we narrow our focus on Ghana and Nigeria. The data are drawn from two different household surveys: the Nigeria General Household Survey, conducted between 2010and 2011, and the Ghana Living Standard Survey, conducted between 2005and 2006. Both surveys gather individual as well as household information. We chose these countries as a place for the analysis, because the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region is among the most vulnerable region to the impacts of climate change. Moreover, both Ghana and Nigeria display a great geographic variability in terms of temperatures and precipitation between the North and the South. Nigeria and Ghana are also countries in which for many households agriculture is still the most important economic activity. As agriculture is more climate sensitive to climate than other sectors, migration decisions are more influenced by climatic factors than in developed economies.\\nMigration not necessarily requires that the entire household moves. The household can retain the local activities and send one or more family members in another location, to look for alternative revenue sources. In this respect we heavily draw on the predictions of the New Economics of Labour Migration, introduced by Stark and Bloom (1985), which emphasizes the role played by the family in migration decisions. The contributing insight of the authors is that the decision to migrate may take place within the family, rather than being an individual choice. Migration of some individuals responds to an overall family strategy, designed to adapt to a variety of conditions, including climate. For example, a farm household may send some members to urban centres to be employed in non-farm activities or to a different rural locations as a form of income diversification, ensured through the transfer of remittances on a regular basis. Climate may also affect migration in households that are engaged in climate insensitive activities as a result of general equilibrium effects at village or regional level.\\nOur results reveal that the relationship between the probability that at least one member of the household is a migrant and temperature in the dry season is hill-shaped. A hill-shaped relationship results as well between precipitation in the wet season and migration. The highest propensity to migrate is at 23 • C during the dry season and at 125 mm/month of precipitation during the wet season. This relationship holds only for households that are engaged in farming activities.\\nThe empirical findings reveal that migration decisions of non-farming households are not affected by climate, presumably because their productivity is not strongly linked, directly or indirectly, to temperature and precipitation levels. Our findings are robust to a series of alternative model specifications. Households located in districts with mild temperatures/precipitations have a positive chance to become migrant families if temperatures/precipitations increase. On the contrary, in districts with already high temperature/precipitations, the reverse occurs. Mild temperatures/precipitations benefit agricultural productivity and make migration more likely. On the contrary, for higher levels of temperatures/precipitations, households may be caught in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape, due to low productivity.\\nWe also calculate non-marginal changes of migration using a uniform +2 • C temperature increase and a +25% precipitation change and by using geographically and seasonally differentiated climate change scenarios generated by the last generation of General Circulation Models using the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The large majority of the scenarios used suggests that climate change may discourage migration in Ghana and Nigeria.\\nA crucial assumption that we share with the Ricardian literature and with all cross-section studies is that the error component is not correlated with the regressors. Omitted variables that are correlated with climate variables would cause estimates of climate coefficients to be biased.\\nAlthough we cannot rule this possibility completely out, two strategies have been pursued. First, fixed effects at geographical level are added in all regressions. These fixed effects should absorb a large array of geographical characteristics and they should be a sufficient control to identify a causal effect in a cross-section analysis. Second a set of robustness tests are conducted, adding controls for soil quality and other geographic variables at district level.\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates the method used to estimate the relationship between climate and migration. Section 3 describes our data set and section 4 presents the empirical findings. Section 5 computes local, regional and national marginal and non-marginal impacts of climate on migration. A concluding section provides a summary and a discussion of results.\",\n",
       "  'Methodology': \"The present paper draws on the insights of the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM), introduced by Stark and Bloom (1985). The contributing insight of the authors is that the decision to migrate may take place within a family or a household context, rather than being a purely \\n* j = γC i + βX j + u j (1)\\nwhere y * is the household's unobservable propensity to migrate, C is a set of location specific seasonal climate variables in local administrative unit i, namely precipitations and temperatures.\\nTemperatures and precipitations enter with a linear and a squared terms, separately for the wet and the dry seasons. X controls for all the household characteristics that affect household production activities.\\nFor each household we count the total number of members who live away and send remittances back home on a regular basis at the time the survey was administered. We define a migration household a family where at least one member is a migrant. In this article we capture the so called extensive margin of climate change on migration, as we assess how the variation in temperature and rainfall influences the number of migrating households, rather than the number of family members migrating (the intensive margin).\\nA household member is someone who is connected to the household by blood or marriage.\\nThe survey does not record the reason for not living within the household and some members may be away momentarily or because they formed a new household. To circumvent this limitation, we consider only households that receive remittances. In this way we better identify household members who move for productive reasons and we exclude those moving for education or marriage.\\nUnfortunately, the survey does not record when migration occurred emigration, but we believe that this is not a problem for this analysis. Climate change occurs slowly and therefore it is not requested to link single episodes of migration with climate variables. What matters in this type of analysis is the cross-section, geographical variation in long-term migration decisions and long-run averages of temperature and of rainfall. Finally, we don't know the individual characteristics of the migrating members. We only know if they live within or outside the country of origin. TSome households report having both internal and international migrants (with remittances). We define as an international migration a household where at least one member is abroad, irrespectively of the number of internal movers. On the contrary, an internal migration household has only members that moved within their own country.\\nClimate influences farm households directly but it also influences non-farm households indirectly via local market effects. Migration decision of farm households is directly influenced by climate, as agriculture is directly related to climate. Migration in non-farm households could be indirectly affected, through linkages between agricultural income, demand for non agricultural goods and demand for non-agricultural labor. Given that the channels are different in the two samples, all estimations are conducted for farm and non-farm households separately.\\nAmong the household characteristics that enter specification (1), we include an indicator of household welfare. Welfare certainly affects migration decisions but the sign of the relationship is ambiguous,, being correlated with the household income generation potential and the ability to secure against risk. On the one hand, wealthier households can invest more in local adaptation and therefore should have a lower propensity to migrate. On the other hand, poorer families may have greater incentive to migrate but they may also lack the resources to finance migration, and therefore might not be able to migrate. The welfare variable is computed applying the principal component technique (Filmer and Pritchett, 2001). 1 The advantage of this index is that it aggregates into a single measure a range of different variables, which individually may not be sufficient to differentiate the welfare characteristics of the household. In this study, the components that enter the index are related to the ownership of specific assets (e.g.: fridge, television .) or the characteristics of the housing structure. Given that the components that enter the formula are not solely influenced by the productivity of the household activities, this index measures the general welfare of the family.\\nThe asset index could be endogenous to the migration decision, as the assets that enter the index may be purchased through migrant remittances. To limit the potential endogeneity, the index is computed using the dwelling characteristics and the ownership of durables as they were five years before the surveys used in this study were conducted.\\nThe other explanatory variables for migration include age, gender and the educational attainment of the household head, the number of dependents, the urban or non-urban location of the family, the ownership of livestock and a control to distinguish between Nigeria and Ghana.\\nThe vector of explanatory variables should contain only variables that are exogenous to climate (Dell et al., 2014). The presence of controls that are themselves an outcome of climate would produce an over-controlling problem. For this reason we first present results of a specification where only climate variables are included. We then add the other demographic controls discussed above to assess the effect of climate on migration over and above its effect through the demographic controls.\",\n",
       "  'The data': \"The data for this analysis are drawn from two different household surveys: the Nigeria General Household Survey, conducted between 2010 and 2011, and the Ghana Living Standard Survey, conducted between 2005 and 2006. Both surveys gather individual as well as household information.\\nThe surveys provide an agriculture module, which allows us to distinguish between farm and non-farm households. We define a farm household any family which reports a farm or a plot operated by a household member.\\nMigration is a widely spread phenomenon both in Ghana and in Nigeria, with 43 and 23 per cent of households in Ghana and Nigeria, respectively, reporting at least one family member living away from the family (Table 1). The majority of households are classified as internal migration families, as they do not report any member living abroad. In Nigeria it is documented that a considerable part of the moves are represented by rural-urban migration (Black et al., 2006). In Europe and North America Nigerians represent the largest group of foreigners amongst Africans, although they correspond to a limited proportion of Nigeria's vast population. In Ghana internal migration is primarily from north to south, with in-migrants representing a large share of the population in the Greater Accra, Volta and Western regions. This internal flows are fueled by infertile soils and underdeveloped local services in the North (Black et al., 2006). The majority of migrant families reports only one member who lives away and sends remittances back home, but there are families who can quote more the one mover (Table 2).\\nAs far as agriculture is concerned, farming and livestock raising are by far the most important activities of households in both countries. As indicated in Table 3, nearly 48.5 and 44.1 per cent of the households report a farm or a plot operated by a household member or are engaged in raising animals in Ghana and Nigeria, respectively. Both in Nigeria and Ghana, as in many developing countries, the majority of rural agricultural households operates with small land holdings, which tend to produce few commodities at subsistence level. They barely have access to irrigation, improved seeds or fertilizer (Chamberlin, 2007;Liverpool-Tasie et al. 2011). These features are confirmed by the data, as indicated in Table 4. Less than one percent of households in Ghana and 4 percent in Nigeria has access to irrigation devices, and 0.2 and 1.5 percent owns a tractor, in\\nGhana and Nigeria respectively. The percentage of farming households reaches 73.9 and 72.6 per cent in northern Ghana and in northern Nigeria, respectively. The northern areas in both countries are also those where poverty is more widespread (Omonona, 2009;World Bank, 2011). The northsouth divide is also confirmed by the surveys. The asset index that measures the welfare of the households display higher scores in the south compared to the north (Table 5). The difference in the average index between the southern and the northern households is larger in Nigeria than in Ghana, being 1.03 units the difference in Nigeria and 0.78 unit in Ghana.\\nIn Ghana, migration occurs more likely among the farm households (Table 6). 48.3 percent of farm households reports a member away, whereas among the non-farm households, the percentage of migrant families declines to 38.8 per cent. In Nigeria, on the contrary, farm households are marginally less likely to be migrant families than non-farm households.\\nGridded climatologies of 1961-1990 monthly mean temperature and precipitations have been obtained from the CRU CL v2.0 data set developed by the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (New et al., 2003). Gridded climate data has been down-scaled at each region's centroid by averaging the four closest grid points, with weights inversely proportional to distance.\\nBoth For precipitation changes we proceed analogously but we consider percentage changes rather than changes in levels, as it is common practice in the literature.\\nIt is important to note that future climate change scenarios are fundamentally uncertain. We lack information to attribute probabilities to each scenario and thus it is not possible to determine the most likely future outcome. Thus, the average of all climate change scenarios should not be interpreted as the expected climate scenario. However, due to space concerns, we present in the article only three representative impact scenarios, for both RCPs, in 2071-2100. The scenarios for the other models and for 2031-2060 are presented in the Appendix.\\nSoil data used in the robustness tests is from the FAO HWSD data set.3 A full description of the soil characteristics used in the analysis is provided in the Appendix.\",\n",
       "  'Empirical Evidence': \"In this section we present the estimates of equation ( 1). We control for a series of household and geographic characteristics. First, we describe the demographic characteristics of the household using the age, the gender and the educational attainment of the household head, as well as the number of dependents. Second, we control for the geographic location of the household. We include a dummy for whether the household is urban or not. We also add regional and county fixed effects.\\nThird, we introduce a dummy variable that captures whether the household owns livestock or not.\\nFourth, we include a measure of household welfare. Finally, we add regional and country fixed effects. The choice of the control variables is in line with other NELM models of migration. To account for possible correlation within geographical areas, standard errors are clustered at local level.\\nTable 8 presents the empirical findings, for farm and non-farm households separately. In specifications (1) and (3) we introduce only climate variables. Specifications (2) and (4) add also the control variables described above. Both the linear and the quadratic coefficients of temperature during the dry season are significant in the farm household specifications. We find a hill-shaped relationship between temperature in the dry season and the propensity to migrate. We also find a significant hill-shaped relationship between precipitations in the wet seasons and the propensity to migrate. These effects do not feature in the non-farm households. None of the climate coefficients are statistically significant in the non-farm specification.\\nAs far as the other controls are concerned , the table shows that wealthier households display a greater likelihood to migrate, as indicated by the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the welfare index. This indicates that poorer families may not find the resources to emigrate. The number of dependents does not influence the propensity to migrate. Location has a remarkable effect on the likelihood of migration but only among non-farm household. Among farm operating household, living in a urban setting makes migration more likely. Migration is not significantly influenced by the gender and the age of the head.\\nHigh skills are not a critical asset for migration for farm-operating households, whereas they represent a critical asset for non-farm ones. Families with a secondary and a tertiary educated heads are significantly more likely to migrate compared to families with basic and no education.\\nNigerian families display lower propensity to migrate compared to Ghanaian families. Among farm operated families, those owning livestock are more likely to migrate than those who don't own any.\\nLivestocks represent an asset for households that augments family wealth.\\nThe coefficients of the climate variables are robust to the inclusion of the demographic controls, both in terms of size and in terms of magnitude. A hill-shaped relationship indicates that farm households located in districts with mild temperatures/precipitations have a positive chance to become migrant families if temperatures/precipitations increase. In districts with already high temperature/precipitations, the reverse occurs. In a rural, underdeveloped setting the relationship between agricultural productivity and climate is usually hill-shaped (Kurukulasuriya et al. 2006). A possible interpretation of our findings is that at the optimal climatic conditions for farming, families are able to find the resources to emigrate. On the contrary, at high temperatures/precipitations, households may be caught in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape.\\nAn interesting extension to this analysis would test the link between climate and productivity. 4\\nThe existing empirical studies find a moderate evidence that households respond to weather adversities by migrating. However, there is also some evidence that better weather and environmental conditions increase migration by allowing households to escape from a poverty trap (Barrett, 2008;Gray, 2009;Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Weather adversities in Gray and Mueller (2012a) do not influence mobility, likely because the shocks decrease available resources for migration.\\nTo give strength to these results, a set of robustness checks are conducted for the farm house-4 Unfortunately it is not possible to compute a reliable measure of agriculture productivity using the available data sets. The two surveys collect different information on agricultural inputs and therefore the productivity is not comparable between the two datasets. The existing literature on migration has identified that the networks formed by friends and relatives with previous migration experience is as an important determinant of migration. The networks diffuse information regarding opportunities related to labor and credit markets at destination and alleviate the risks of migration (Palloni et al., 2001;Massey and Espinosa,1997;Winters et al. 2001;McKenzie and Rapoport, 2011;Munshi, 2003). These factors contribute to increase the likelihood of migration. Table 9 adds a network variable, computed as the total number of migrants moving from the same local area of household j. 5 The coefficient of the network is positive but it is not statistically significant. We are aware that this is a poor proxy for the network, as stronger ties than just being a migrant from the same origin area should be embedded in the variable. For example a stronger link should develop from persons of the same area of origin migrated to the same local destination. Unfortunately detailed information on the destinations of migrants is not Available, neither in the Census nor in the survey. The hill-shaped relationship described above is robust to the inclusion of the network variable.\\nA cross sectional analysis of migration decisions can produce biased coefficients due to omitted variables (Schlenker et al., 2005;Deschenes and Greenstone, 2007;Dell et al., 2014). In other words, the empirical estimates can be driven by the presence of time invariant confounders that cannot be disentangled from the climate variables. To address this issue, all regressions are estimated controlling for geographical fixed effects. After controlling for these fixed effects, we expect temperature and precipitations in each local areas to be the main determinant of migration. However, the geographical boundaries of these controls are quite large (regions in Ghana and states in Nigeria). We introduce additional geographical controls at local level to avoid the possibility that other factors that vary within the regions and the statesmay bias the estimates. Average elevation, the standard deviation of elevation and distance from big cities are controlled for. Elevation affects climate directly but also affects economic productivity and mobility through other channels. Distance from large cities may be correlated with climate as remote areas may have an hostile climate. 6\\nNone of the coefficients of the geographical variables turned statistically significant (Table 10). The coefficient of the precipitation variable in the wet season and its squared are robust to the inclusion of these geographical controls. On the contrary, the coefficients of temperature in the dry season 5 The data to compute the network variable are taken from the 2000 Census for Ghana and from the LSMS for Nigeria. Individual weights are used. 6 The distance is calculated from the centroid of the district in which the household lives. We use three population thresholds to define cities: greater than 100,000 (100k in Table 10), between 100,000 and 500,000 (100k-500k in Table 10) and greater than 500,000 (¿500k in Table 10).\",\n",

Our results indicate that some soil characteristics are significant and have a sign that is consistent with agronomic evidence. However, the sign and the magnitude of the estimated climate coefficient, in particular of the precipitation variable are invariant, thus indicating that omitted variable might not be a problem in our main specification.\\nThe agriculture module of the survey provides detailed information on agricultural activities engaged by the households. In this section we distinguish households depending on the specific activity they conduct. In particular we define a crop-farm household, a household engaged in planting and harvesting crops only. We define an animal-farm household one which is employed in raising animals and not in planting or harvesting crops. Finally a mixed-farm household is engaged in both activities. Table 11 presents the empirical findings where the households are distinguish according to these criteria. Interestingly, none of the climate variables have a significant influence on migration among households engaged in raising animals only (column 2). Eventually, this results is consistent with the idea that animals cope better with climatic extremes than crops. Farms specialized in raising animals are less climate sensitive than crop-farms. On the contrary, families solely engaged in cropping activities display the hill-shaped relationship between migration and precipitation in the wet season.\\nThe survey allows us to identify if family members migrated within or outside the country of origin. We define as international-migrant a household where at least one member is abroad. On the contrary, an internal-migrant household has only domestic migrants. Equation 1 is separately estimated for these two households types and the results are presented in Table 12. While precipitations in the wet season are still a strong and significant determinant of internal migration, the coefficient of rainfall is no longer significant among international migration households. Moreover, temperature in the dry season is not statistically significant in any of the specifications. International migration is a costly phenomenon. Households that own the resources to send members abroad are not influenced by any climate-related issues. Climate neither boosts nor hinders the possibility to migrate internationally. In a final regression we compute a different proxy for mi- 7 We control for: the Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) in soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.); the electrical conductivity of soil, measured in dS/m; the organic carbon in soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.); the percentage of sand and clay in soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.); the pH of the soil, measured in concentration levels (-log(H+)); the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil, measured in cmol/kg; the calcium carbonate (lime) content, as percentage of total soil weight (%wt.); the calcium sulphate (gypsum) content of soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.). For more information on these variables see the Appendix.',\n",

Rather than capturing permanent migration of members, who left but are still connected to the household by sending remittances, we analyse temporary migration. A temporary migrant is a household member who is still part of the family but who in the previous 12 months has left the households for more than one month. This form of migration is typically a temporary, circular migration, in that a person moves back and forth from origin to destination. For example, a person might move for a seasonal job. The coefficient of the precipitation variable in the wet season is positive and statistically significant (column 3). This finding indicates that both temporary and permanent forms of migration are influenced by climate.\\nA caveat of this analysis is that only households with at least one member still in the original location are interviewed. This issue introduces a possible downward bias in the estimates at locations with high temperatures and at the very dry and very wet regions. Entire families might have moved, either domestically or internationally, in response to climate. Unfortunately it is not possible to account for these missing families.',\n",
       "  'Marginal and non-marginal impacts of climate on migration': \"In our preferred model specification (column 4 of Table 8) we find a quadratic significant relationship between the probability to migrate and temperature in the dry season and precipitations in the wet season. For this specification we compute the marginal effects of temperature and precipitation.\\nThe non-linearity in the relationship between climate and migration implies that the marginal impacts of temperature and precipitations vary at different temperature and precipitation levels.\\nThe marginal impact also depends on the value taken by all the other control variables. Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the impact of 1 • C of additional temperature and of 1cm of additional rainfall at the average of all other control variables.\\nThe marginal effect of temperature increase is initially positive and becomes negative at 24 We also compute the marginal effects at district level, at the average value of all other control variables for households in that district. Figure 3  As in the Ricardian literature, we estimate the impact of non-marginal changes of temperature and precipitations on each household's probability to migrate, keeping anything else fixed. We take the difference of the estimated probability to migrate with the future climate and we subtract from it the probability to migrate estimated with the 1961-1990 climate. This difference provides an estimate of the impact of an instantaneous change of climate. We start examining a uniform (over space and seasons) +2 • C temperature and +25% precipitation scenario. We display in Figure 4 2 in the Appendix provides summary statistics for all models, scenarios and RCP trajectories. Figures A-1 to A-8 display district-and regional-level maps of changes of the probability to migrate for 2031-2060, 2071-2100, for both the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5. Results from the other models are similar to those displayed in Figure 5. There is surprisingly low variation of results across different models.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions': 'Our study shows that climate affects migration in farm households in Ghana and Nigeria. We find a hill-shaped relationship between temperature in the dry season and the propensity to migrate as well as between precipitations in the wet seasons and the propensity to migrate. None of the climate coefficients are statistically significant in the non-farm households. This suggests that climate affects migration by affecting the productivity of agriculture.\\nA possible interpretation is that at favorable climatic conditions for farming, families are able to find the resources to migrate. On the contrary, at high temperatures/precipitations, households may be caught in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape. While the negative link between harmful weather and migration has been documented in short-run analyses, which do not embody the full set of adaptations (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013;Gray, 2009), our study is the first example where this link features in a long-run perspective, which accounts for a larger set of adaptation measures.\\nThe analysis of marginal and non-marginal changes of temperature and precipitation reveals that climate change may reduce migration in Ghana and Nigeria, ceteris paribus. The subsistence level of agricultural households in Ghana and Nigeria can explain these findings. Adverse climatic conditions reduce the productivity of agriculture, even after including the whole set of present adaptations to climate. This productivity loss has a negative impact on the capital stock of households and reduces migration. While adaptation through migration is found to be a mechanism to respond to shocks and increased risks in the short-run by a growing literature, the long-run relationship between climate and migration seems to be more complex, as more factors affect households decisions. Our results suggest thatfor many poor households in Ghana and Nigeria migration does not appear to be a possible adaptation to climate change.\\nThe method that we developed in this article can be replicated in other countries for which data on migration is available with a high geographic resolution. Ideally, future studies should cover areas with larger temperature variance than in our study. One of the limits of our study is     Note: For Ghana, not all households specified the destination of the household members, whether abroad or in Ghana, and therefore the percentage in columns ( 3) and ( 4) should represent a lower bound. The summary statistics are computed using sample weights.            ',\n",

       "  'Introduction': \"Soil degradation, including soil erosion and nutrient depletion, is widely considered to be an important factor undermining the livelihoods of smallholder agriculturalists in the developing world (Stocking, 2003). Smallholders often lack the capital to maintain soil resources, but without external inputs the productivity of soils under continuous cultivation inevitably declines, potentially exacerbating rural poverty and creating a poverty trap (Barrett, 2008). Drawing on field measures of soil erosion and nutrient balance, soil scientists have long argued that the scope of this problem is severe (Stoorvogel and Smaling, 1990;Sanchez, 2002), particularly in the East African highlands where rural population densities are high, poverty is endemic, and access to modern agricultural inputs is poor (Pender et al., 2006).\\nMore recently, however, a collection of social scientists have challenged this interpretation on the basis of smallholder experiences and the limitations of soil studies (Scoones and Toulmin, 1998;Mortimore and Harris, 2005), arguing instead that ''soil fertility is a major constraint to production for some people in some places at some times'' (Scoones, 1997, p. 162). Perpetuating this debate is the absence of any large-scale program to monitor soil degradation (Richter, 2007), though an effort to systematically map soil types across Africa is now underway (Sanchez et al., 2009). Also lacking are studies to assess the consequences of soil degradation for social and economic outcomes beyond agricultural production, particularly at the household scale. Together these lacunae leave unclear the extent to which soil degradation undermines the well-being of smallholder households in vulnerable regions such as the East African highlands.\\nAmong potential social outcomes of soil degradation, human migration is of particular interest. A parallel debate has considered the extent to which a variety of forms of environmental change contribute to rural out-migration and population mobility. This issue rose to prominence with a widely-cited study by Myers (1997), who claimed that 25 million people were displaced by soil degradation and other forms of environmental change as of 1995. This specific claim has since largely been dismissed (Kniveton et al., 2008), but accumulating evidence of global environmental change has reinforced the salience of this issue (Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009;Warner, 2010). Only recently, however, have quantitative studies begun to address these claims by linking survey data on migration to high-resolution environmental datasets, with results that only partly support the assumption that environmental change is an important driver of migration (Henry et al., 2004;Massey et al., 2010). Very few of these studies have investigated the effects of soil quality on migration (Laurian et al., 1998;Gray, 2010), and none have used data from soil samples.\\nThis study addresses both of these debates by evaluating the effects of soil quality on internal migration from grain-producing households in highland Kenya and Uganda. These two countries Soil degradation is widely considered to be a key factor undermining agricultural livelihoods in the developing world and contributing to rural out-migration. To date, however, few quantitative studies have examined the effects of soil characteristics on human migration or other social outcomes for potentially vulnerable households. This study takes advantage of a unique longitudinal survey dataset from Kenya and Uganda containing information on household-level soil properties to investigate the effects of soil quality on population mobility. Random effects multinomial logit models are used to test for effects of soil quality on both temporary and permanent migration while accounting for a variety of potential confounders. The analysis reveals that soil quality significantly reduces migration in Kenya, particularly for temporary labor migration, but marginally increases migration in Uganda. These findings are consistent with several previous studies in showing that adverse environmental conditions tend to increase migration but not universally, contrary to common assumptions about environmentallyinduced migration.\\nß 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\\nhave featured prominently in the debate over the consequences of soil degradation and a large proportion of their populations are poor smallholders dependent on vulnerable soil resources (Ehui and Pender, 2005). The study takes advantage of a unique longitudinal survey dataset collected by the REPEAT project that includes data on both migration and soil properties for 1200 households (Matsumoto et al., 2006). These data are used to build a household-level measure of soil quality and individual-level measures of temporary and permanent out-migration for labor and other reasons. Random effects multinomial logit models are then used to test the effects of soil quality on migration while controlling for a variety of individual and household characteristics. The results indicate that, consistent with common assumptions, out-migration declined with soil quality in Kenya, particularly for households with small farms. However, reflecting important differences between these two countries, migration in Uganda marginally increased with soil quality, consistent instead with the existence of a poverty trap.\",\n",

       "  'Soils as natural capital': \"For agricultural households, soils can be thought of as a form of natural capital that supports rural livelihoods and complements reserves of human, social and physical capitals (Ellis, 2000). Physical, chemical and biological properties of soils all contribute to their suitability for agriculture or soil quality, and these properties vary over space and time at scales that are highly salient to household decision-making (Tittonell et al., 2005;Govaerts et al., 2006). Soil quality can also serve as a key form of household wealth and is an important contributor to land value (Gardner and Barrows, 1985). Just as for other forms of capital, households can also act to both improve and degrade soil quality. Inorganic or organic inputs can be applied to maintain or improve the quality of soils under cultivation, but unchecked erosion or continuous cultivation without inputs (e.g., soil mining) will eventually undermine the quality of even highly-productive agricultural soils (Kapkiyai et al., 1999;Richter et al., 2007).\\nIn many agricultural regions of the developing world, declining soil quality or soil degradation is believed to be severe and widespread (Sanchez, 2002), though these claims are not without controversy (Mortimore and Harris, 2005). A common scenario, recognized by both sides of this debate, is that farmers are aware of soil quality decline but lack the capital to invest in soil amendments. Positive feedbacks can exacerbate this process in that falling agricultural yields can undermine the household's ability to invest in inputs, leading to further declines in soil quality (Shepherd and Soule, 1998). Some studies have also found biophysical thresholds in soil quality below which it is not profitable to invest in soil amendments (Antle and Stoorvogel, 2006;Marenya and Barrett, 2009). Together these processes could theoretically lead to the formation of poverty traps from which poor households with low soil quality could not escape (Barrett, 2008), though as of yet little empirical evidence exists for this outcome. Additionally, it is important to note that the operation of these processes is likely to differ significantly from site to site given important heterogeneity in underlying biophysical, social and economic conditions (Blaikie, 1985;Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987).\",\n",
       "  'Soils and migration': \"One option for households with low soil quality is to send temporary or permanent out-migrants, a decision which can generate additional income, reduce consumption in the origin household, and diversify household livelihood strategies against the risk of agricultural failure (Stark and Bloom, 1985). This process, in which poor environmental quality leads to outmigration, is consistent with a simple push-pull model of migration (Petersen, 1958) and with the expectations of the majority of the literature on environmentally-induced migration (Myers, 1997;Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009).\\nMultiple qualitative and quantitative studies have also documented a positive relationship between soil quality decline and rural out-migration. Among qualitative and small-scale studies, Zweifler et al. (1994) observed that migration, soil degradation and land scarcity jointly increased over a period of decades in a rural highland community in the Dominican Republic. Additionally, Warren et al. (2001) documented a positive correlation between soil erosion and male out-migration for a rural community in southwest Niger. Finally, Carr (2008) found that community members in two of three regions in rural Guatemala reported soil degradation as an important underlying cause of out-migration. Among quantitative studies, Laurian et al. (1998) showed that men's out-migration declined with self-reported high soil quality in the Ecuadorian Amazon but women's migration was not affected. Henry et al. (2003), using census data from Burkina Faso and a global map of soil degradation, found that out-migration increased with soil degradation. Finally, Massey et al. (2010) used longitudinal survey data from lowland Nepal to show that migration increased with perceived declines in agricultural productivity, particularly for low-caste individuals. The latter finding is consistent with the common view that poor and marginal populations will be more severely affected by adverse environmental conditions (Wisner et al., 2004).\\nThe studies suggest that the most common relationship will be for out-migration to be higher where soil quality is poor. Nonetheless, both migration theory and a subset of previous studies indicate that the opposite effect is also possible, i.e. that out-migration might be higher where soil quality is high. The key theoretical issue is that the demands of migration, such as access to migrant networks and the cost of housing, can be high relative to household resources and thus create barriers for entry that exclude poor households from particular migration streams (White and Lindstrom, 2005). In extreme cases, a poverty trap might prevent agricultural households from both purchasing agricultural inputs and sending out-migrants. Consistent with the view are studies showing that international migrants often originate from land-rich households (VanWey, 2005;Gray, 2009). Among studies of environmentally-induced migration, Henry et al. (2004) also found that international migration of men from Burkina Faso decreased with drought, and Halliday (2006) found that international migration from El Salvador decreased following an earthquake. Particularly relevant to this study, Gray (2010) found that international migration of women from Ecuador decreased with perceived soil erosion. These studies indicate that positive effects of soil quality on migration are possible, though this has not yet been demonstrated for the case of internal migration.\",\n",
       "  'Data collection and study area': '',\n",
       "  'Data collection': 'The survey and soils data were collected as part of the REPEAT project (Research on Poverty, Environment, and Agricultural Technology) based at the National Policy Institute for Graduate Studies in Tokyo, Japan (GRIPS) (Matsumoto et al., 2006). 1 In both Kenya and Uganda, longitudinal interviews were conducted with approximately 900 households. In both cases, households were sampled from the respondents to a previous household survey, conducted by the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya and by the International Food Policy Research Institute in Uganda. The first REPEAT survey in Kenya was conducted in 2004, and 899 households were interviewed from five highland provinces (Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Central and Eastern) and 99 rural sublocations 2 (Yamano et al., 2005). An immediate follow-up survey was conducted in late 2004 with the same households, but data from both 2004 rounds are combined here and referred to collectively as the first round. A subsequent followup survey was conducted in 2007, and 777 households were successfully interviewed following the exclusion of 71 households from Eastern province for logistical reasons. In Uganda, the first round REPEAT survey was conducted in 2003, and 940 households were interviewed in 94 rural local councils in the Eastern, Central and Western regions (Yamano et al., 2004). The Northern region was excluded due to security issues. In 2005 a second round was conducted and 895 households were successfully re-interviewed. Rates of attrition were thus low and regression analyses of this process indicate that it was not significantly influenced by soil quality.\\nAt the time of the first-round surveys (but not the second-round surveys), soil samples were collected from grain-producing households either from the largest plot maize or another grainproducing plot if maize was not grown. Samples were collected to a depth of 20 cm from five positions in the plot and mixed. Samples were then analyzed at the World Agroforestry Center using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, a method which is particularly appropriate for large sample sizes (Matsumoto and Yamano, 2009). In this method, soil reflectance across near-infrared wavelengths is measured using a portable spectrometer. These values are then transformed into measures of soil chemical and physical properties using multivariate adaptive regression splines fit to samples which had also undergone traditional laboratory analysis. These models have R 2 values of 0.70-0.90 indicating a good fit (Shepherd and Walsh, 2002). The following soil properties were derived for each sample: percent carbon, percent nitrogen, extractable calcium, extractable potassium, extractable phosphorus, percent clay and pH. Following the exclusion of non-grain producing households and the loss of a small number of soil samples, these data are available for 682 households in Kenya and 561 households in Uganda.',\n",
       "  'Study area': \"As described above and displayed in Fig. 1, the study locations span the majority of the area of Uganda as well as the adjacent Kenyan highlands, the country's most populated region and agricultural center. This binational study area is notable for its high suitability for agriculture and dense rural populations relative to other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (Pender et al., 2006). This study locations range from 1000 to 2700 m above sea level and the climate ranges from semi-arid and subtropical to moist and temperate. The suitability of the soils for agriculture is moderate to high, and soil types include Oxisols, Ultisols, Inceptisols, and, in a few areas, Vertisols and Andisols (USDA, 2005). Smallholder agriculture is the primary land use and farm sizes are relatively small (5.6 acres on average in the study sample). Nutrient balance studies suggest that soil degradation is severe in many locations (Stoorvogel and Smaling, 1990;Nkonya et al., 2005), but farmers tend to perceive the problem as moderate (Kiome and Stocking, 1995;Adams and Watson, 2003) and some areas have notably escaped predictions of population-induced soil degradation (Tiffen et al., 1994;Carswell, 2002). Maize, beans and bananas are the primary subsistence crops, supplemented by income from cattle and milk production, cash crops such as coffee, and off-farm employment.\\nTemporary and permanent forms of migration are also important livelihood strategies in both Kenya and Uganda (Black et al., 2006). Both countries continue to be predominantly rural, and rural-rural migration is common, particularly in association with lifecourse transitions such as marriage (Black et al., 2006;Oucho, 2007). Both countries are also rapidly urbanizing, focused on the capital cities of Nairobi and Kampala, providing many opportunities for both temporary and permanent urban-bound migrants, who are disproportionately male and well-educated (Hoddinott, 1994;Agesa, 2001). Many temporary urban migrants repeatedly return to the same destination and source of employment, leaving their families in their place of origin (Bigsten, 1996;Matsumoto et al., 2006). Rates of international migration are low relative to internal migration (Black et al., 2006). Armed conflict in northern Uganda has also contributed to involuntary displacement (Vinck and Pham, 2009), but the affected areas were excluded from the REPEAT study.\\nDespite these commonalities, there are also important differences in the characteristics and contexts of the study households between Kenya and Uganda (Ehui and Pender, 2005;Pender et al., 2006). In Kenya, especially in the central highlands near Nairobi, there is good access to urban markets and agricultural inputs, and many households have successfully diversified their livelihood strategies and intensified their agricultural and animal production, resulting in significantly higher standards of living. In contrast, in most of rural Uganda access to urban markets and agricultural inputs remains poor and standards of living are significantly lower. Uganda is also considerably more diverse both in terms of ethnicity and land tenure institutions. Nearly all agricultural land in Kenya is under private tenure, but in Uganda there are at least four distinct tenure systems (customary, mailo, freehold and leasehold), reflecting the historical experiences of different regions and varying packages of rights for owners versus users (Nkonya et al., 2008).\\nThese differences are reflected in results from the first-round REPEAT surveys (Yamano et al., 2004(Yamano et al., , 2005;;Matsumoto et al., 2006; author's calculations). The consumption-based poverty rate was twice as high in Uganda (30%) as in Kenya (15%), and Ugandan homes were more often made of unimproved materials (mud walls, thatch roofs and earth floors). Ugandan adults on average also had fewer years of education (8.2) than Kenyans (5.7), and  2 Kenyan sublocations and Ugandan local councils are both small administrative units containing one or more rural villages. For simplicity they are referred to jointly as ''locations''.\\nUgandan households were more dependent on crop production, which represented 59% of their incomes. In contrast, Kenyan livelihoods were considerably more diversified, with non-farm employment, livestock, and migrant remittances providing 38%, 21% and 7% of household income respectively. Among Kenyan households, 80% used chemical fertilizers and 63% applied manure, whereas only 7% and 16% of Ugandan households used these inputs. Similarly, 68% of Kenyan cattle were from improved breeds, versus only 22% of Ugandan cattle.\\nRegarding ethnic and tenure diversity, seven ethnicities were represented among the Kenyan households and nearly half of households were Kikuyu, whereas the Ugandan households included members of 28 ethnicities with no dominant group. In Kenya, almost all agricultural plots were privately held (with 13% rented-in), whereas Ugandan plots were variously held under customary (46%) or freehold tenure (41%), will a smaller proportion under mailo tenure (13%). Consistent with evidence that all three Ugandan forms of tenure often serve as de facto individualized tenure (Nkonya et al., 2008), a majority of plot owners across all three types (64-81%) reported being able to sell their plots.\",\n",
       "  'Analysis': 'The analysis of the effects of soil quality on migration proceeded in three steps as described below. First, the soils data were used to build a household-level measure of soil quality. Second, the survey data were used to build four individual-level measures of migration, which were linked in an individual-level dataset containing potential predictors of migration. Third, random effects multinomial logit models were used to examine the influences of soil quality and other factors on migration. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.',\n",
       "  'Soil quality': 'To build a measure of soil quality, principal components analysis was used to construct an index of the seven measured soil properties. This is a common approach to reducing data dimensionality, and creates an index that maximizes the proportion of variance explained in the underlying data (Sena et al., 2002). Raw values of the seven soil measures are presented in Table 1. Consistent with previous studies, these values indicate the soils of the study area are relatively fertile overall but with considerable variability, particularly in Kenya. The values of five measures, those for carbon, nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus, were strongly right-skewed and thus were transformed by ln(x + 1) prior to the analysis to reduce the influence of outlying values. To remove any influence of the scale of measurement, all seven measures were then standardized into z-scores prior to conducting the analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that the first principal component explained 50% of the variance and the variable loadings for this component are consistent with a measure of soil quality. The loading increases with the levels of carbon, nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus and decreases with the level of clay (Table 1). The value of the first principal component was rescaled to range from 0 to 10, and this value is referred to below as the soil quality index.\\nThe soil quality index is also highly correlated with two other potential measures of soil productivity: the first principal component of the soil spectrometer readings across all wavelengths (r = 0.92), and a measure of soil organic matter which was measured using traditional laboratory techniques for the Uganda samples (r = 0.82). Both of these alternative measures have been linked to improved crop yields in previous analyses of the REPEAT data (Matsumoto et al., 2008;Yamano, 2008). These results suggest the highly-correlated soil quality index constructed here is also an appropriate measure, with the additional benefits of being available for both countries and being a transparent function of key soil properties. Robustness checks incorporating these alternative measures or equivalent indices derived separately for each country replicate the key features of the results presented below.\\nThe soil quality index has a skewed and multimodal distribution that likely reflects nonlinear soil processes and the clustering of soil properties around discrete soil types (Fig. 2). To simplify the interpretation of this measure, it is collapsed for the primary regression specification into a simple dichotomous indicator for index values greater than the global median (2.79). This indicator is referred to as high soil quality. To capture any limitations of this approach three alternative specifications are also tested: a linear specification using the raw soil quality index, a four-category indicator for the quartile of the soil quality distribution, and an equivalent dichotomous measure for soil carbon only, referred to as high soil carbon. Soil carbon is a key measure of soil quality that is particularly resistant to change over time (Kapkiyai et al., 1999;Richter et al., 2007), and this measure is included to address the possibility that other measured soil properties might be responsive in the short-term to land management decisions and thus endogenous to household livelihood strategies (see Section 4.4).',\n",
       "  'Migration': 'To characterize the diversity of population mobility in the study locations, four migration outcomes were constructed by drawing on a question about migration asked in both rounds of the survey and on the longitudinal aspect of the data. In the household roster, the survey recorded the number of months that each member had lived at home in the previous 12 months, and, for those who were absent, coded the motivation for their absence. Using the firstround survey, household members who had lived in the household for 1-11 months in the previous year were defined to be temporary migrants. These were further classified into those who had departed for employment-related reasons (labor migrants) and for other reasons (non-labor migrants) to create a multinomial outcome. Non-labor migration was most commonly for schooling, marriage or to live with other family members. Then, drawing on the longitudinal aspect of the data, individuals who were resident for one or more months at baseline but were resident for zero months at follow-up were defined to be permanent migrants, and again classified as labor or non-labor migrants based on the motivation for their absence. Individuals can be both temporary and permanent migrants if they were temporarily absent in the first round and fully absent in the second round. However only one motivation was recorded for each move, thus both temporary and permanent moves were classified as either labor-related or nonlabor-related but not both. The destination of moves was not recorded, thus this definition likely includes some moves that would be excluded by a restrictive definition of migration (see Section 4.4).\\nTo analyze these outcomes, an individual-level dataset containing the migration measures was linked to the household-level measure of soil quality and several control variables, all measured in the first-round survey (Table 2). At the individual level, control variables include gender, age, relationship to the household head, marital status and years of education. At the household level these include household size, gender of the head, agricultural land area, and the value of livestock. As the latter two variables are censored at zero and right-skewed, these values were transformed by ln(x + 1) prior to inclusion, and in both cases a squared term was added to allow for nonlinear effects. Examination of Table 2 reveals that, consistent with the description above, asset values and levels of education are higher in Kenya. However, both farm and household sizes are larger in Uganda, and overall soil quality is similar.\\nTogether these controls account for the majority of important small-scale influences on migration that have been identified by previous studies (White and Lindstrom, 2005). Preliminary analyses also explored the inclusion of measures of migrant networks at the level of the household and location (i.e. sublocation/local council), which were derived from reports of departures prior to the first-round REPEAT survey. Ultimately these were excluded because (1) household-level networks might reflect the effects of past soil quality, (2) location-level networks were not well measured for small and singleton clusters, and (3) inclusion of these predictors did not substantially alter the effects of soil quality described below.\\nPreliminary regression models of the four outcomes revealed that rates of migration were very low for household heads, their spouses, and individuals under age 18 and over age 49, and they were thus excluded from the analysis as not at risk of migration. This finding and analytical approach are both consistent with previous studies (e.g., Hoddinott, 1994;Gray, 2009). Households without soils data were also excluded. The results can thus be interpreted as applying to individuals who are at risk for migration in grain-producing households. Following these exclusions, the dataset contains 1343 individuals from 518 households in Kenya and 778 individuals from 307 households in Uganda. Due to attrition and sample exclusions for the second-round surveys, the sample size for permanent migration is smaller, and includes 1013 individuals from Kenya and 654 individuals from Uganda.\\nTable 3 displays propensities of migration for the four migration streams stratified by country and by the dichotomous measure of soil quality. Chi-squared tests were used to compare migration propensities across soil quality categories, and adjusted for clustering at the level of the location. The results reveal that rates  of temporary migration are much higher in Kenya, consistent with reports in the literature (Black et al., 2006). Additionally, approximately one half of temporary migration and one third of permanent migration are motivated by the search for employment.\\nComparisons between households with high and low soil quality reveal that temporary migration and labor-motivated temporary migration in particular were significantly lower from Kenyan households with high soil quality. Thus in Kenyan households with low soil quality 29% of all individuals were temporary migrants, versus 18% in households with high soil quality (p < 0.001).\\nPermanent labor migration was also marginally lower from households with high soil quality in Kenya (p = 0.07). In contrast, permanent non-labor migration was marginally higher from households with high soil quality in Uganda (p = 0.06). These results suggest that soil quality influences migration in the study area, but the results do not account for any other individual, household or contextual characteristics that might be correlated with soil quality. These additional factors are accounted for using multivariate regression models as described below.',\n",
       "  'Regression models': 'Random effects multinomial logit models (Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh, 2004) were estimated to investigate the influences of soil quality on migration while accounting for other factors. This model is appropriate for categorical outcomes and, as described below, accounts for clustering and contextual effects at the level of the household, location and region. For this model, the outcome is coded 0 for no migration, 1 for labor migration, and 2 for non-labor migration. The model is estimated separately for temporary and permanent migration in both Kenya and Uganda, i.e. four versions of the model. The model has one equation for each form of migration (labor and non-labor), with the following form:\\nlog p mi j 1 À p ni j ¼ b m0 þ b mk X mi jk þ a mr þ e m j\\nwhere p mij is the odds of migration for individual i in household j for migration stream m (labor or non-labor migration), p nij is the odds of no migration, b m0 is a stream-specific constant, b mk is a vector of parameters for the effects of the independent variables (k), X mijk is a vector of the independent variables including soil quality, e mj is a household-level random effect, and a mr is a fixed effect for the region, defined as provinces in Kenya and administrative regions in Uganda. All models are also adjusted for clustering at the level of the location (Angeles et al., 2005). For presentation, coefficients are exponentiated (e b ) to create odds ratios, which can be interpreted as the multiplicative effect of a one unit increase in the predictor on the odds of migration. Predicted probabilities of migration can also be derived from this equation. This model corrects for clustering and contextual effects at three levels: the household, the location and the region. The inclusion of household-level random effects accounts for any unobserved characteristics at the household level under the assumption that they are not correlated with the observed characteristics. The adjustment for clustering at the location level additionally corrects for any location-level correlation arising from the clustered sampling strategy. Finally, the inclusion of fixed effects at the regional level accounts for all large-scale contextual factors as long as the effects are linear. This collection of approaches thus accounts for household-level migration strategies, the clustered sampling strategy, and large-scale contextual influences on migration.\\nA supplementary set of models was also estimated to test for interactions between soil quality and the other predictors, allowing the effects of soil quality to vary between population subgroups. This analysis provides insights into which groups are most vulnerable soil quality-induced migration, but should be considered exploratory given the large number of interaction terms that were separately tested for significance.',\n",
       "  'Strengths and weaknesses of the approach': 'The methodological approach described above has several notable strengths. First, the data are derived from a large, binational household survey with a longitudinal component, a type of data that is rarely available for analyses of agriculture and migration in the developing world. Second, the data are even more exceptional for including the results of household-level soil analyses, allowing the construction of multiple measures of biophysical soil quality that do not rely on self-reporting. Third, specific survey questions on migration and the longitudinal nature of the data permit the disaggregation of four different kinds of migration, better capturing the diversity of rural population mobility than many previous studies. Fourth, the use of random effects regression allows controls for variety of potential confounders as well as corrections for contextual effects at the household, location and regional scales.\\nHowever the methodological approach also has at least two weaknesses that should be noted, one specific and one general. The specific issue is that, as mentioned above, data on the distance and destination of moves was not collected, thus it is likely that some moves were to nearby destinations and would not be considered migration under a restrictive definition. This is more likely to be the case for moves made for non-labor-related reasons, such as marriage, relative to labor-related moves which are commonly made to distant destinations (Hoddinott, 1994;Agesa, 2001). The more general issue is that the analysis does not attempt to model potential feedbacks between migration and soil quality, i.e. the possibility that soil quality is endogenous to migration. This problem could arise if past migration influenced soil quality via a loss of access to agricultural labor or the investment of migrant remittances in soil amendments (Crowley and Carter, 2000;Warren et al., 2001). To address this problem, as described above, I have included a measure of soil carbon in an alternative specification of the regression model. Soil carbon is a long-term measure of soil quality that only changes slowly under agricultural management (Kapkiyai et al., 1999;Richter et al., 2007), limiting the possibility that it could be endogenous to past migration.',\n",
       "  'Results': '',\n",
       "  'Kenya': 'The results for Kenya are presented in Table 4. First the results for the control factors and then the results for soil quality are discussed below. Overall the results of the control variables are consistent with previous studies from East Africa (Hoddinott, 1994;Bigsten, 1996;Agesa, 2001). At the individual level, women and married individuals were more likely to become non-labor migrants for both temporary and permanent moves, reflecting the role of women as the most frequent family-related movers and the ties of married individuals to multiple households. Migration was also strongly stratified by age with most moves peaking at ages 25-29, with the exception of permanent labor migration where rates were highest for ages 35-49. The effects of age were strongest for temporary labor migration, reflecting an important lifecourse dimension to this move, and weakest for temporary non-labor migration, consistent with moves to visit and assist other family members. Educated individuals were also more likely to move, particularly for temporary labor migration. Children of the head, with strong ties to the household, were more likely to make laborrelated moves and less likely to make other types of moves.\\nHousehold-level control factors were not as consistently important but also had significant effects. Non-labor migration increased with household size, likely reflecting moves to live with other family members, but labor migration was not affected. Female headship did not influence migration. The nonlinear effects of land area and livestock value were jointly significant for permanent labor migration but not other migration streams. Permanent labor migration decreased with land area but at a decreasing rate. Consistent with the complex nonlinear effects of wealth seen in previous studies (e.g., VanWey, 2005), permanent labor migration is low for households with no livestock, increases to a maximum at $75 of livestock value (the 18th percentile for Kenya) and then declines slowly. Thus land appears to act as an amenity, retaining migrants, as does livestock above a minimum value that is necessary to migrate, likely due to migration costs.\\nConsistent with the descriptive results in Table 3, soil quality had negative effects on migration that were most important for temporary labor migration. In the primary specification with the dichotomous indicator for high soil quality, the odds of temporary labor migration were 67% lower for households with high soil quality (p < 0.001) and the odds of permanent labor migration were 42% lower (p = 0.041). High soil quality was also associated with marginally lower odds of temporary non-labor migration (p = 0.098), and had a negative but non-significant effect on permanent labor migration. The negative effect on temporary labor migration was also evident in the three alternative specifications: temporary labor migration decreased with the linear quality index, was lower for the highest two quartiles of soil quality, and was also significantly lower for households with high soil carbon. Thus there is a clear negative effect of soil quality on temporary labor migration and some evidence for negative effects on other migration streams.',\n",
       "  'Uganda': 'The results for Uganda are presented in Table 5. Overall the results are not as strong as those for Kenya, reflecting the smaller sample size, but an interesting story emerges nonetheless regarding soil quality as described below. Among the control factors, gender did not have significant effects but age was again important. Temporary labor migration and permanent non-labor migration peaked at ages 25-29, permanent labor migration peaked at ages 30-34, and temporary non-labor migration was not affected, similar to the pattern for Kenya. Non-labor temporary migration was again higher for married individuals, though relationship to the head was unimportant. Permanent non-labor migration also unexpectedly decreased with education, potentially reflecting lower family-related mobility for individuals with access to skilled employment.\\nAt the household level, temporary non-labor migration and permanent labor migration both unexpectedly decreased with household size, which may reflect lower per capita resources in these households that are available to invest in migration. The nonlinear effects of land area and livestock value were jointly significant only for temporary labor migration, with a similar pattern to that of permanent labor migration in Kenya. Temporary labor migration decreased at a decreasing rate with land area, and increased rapidly with livestock value to a maximum at $20 (at the 20th percentile for Kenya) and then declined.\\nIn contrast to Kenya but consistent with the descriptive results, soil quality had marginally positive effects on migration, specifically for permanent non-labor migration. In the primary specification, the odds of permanent non-labor migration were 91% higher from households with high soil quality (p = 0.081). This effect was also evident in the linear, categorical and carbon-only specifications.',\n",
       "  'Interaction models': 'A supplementary set of exploratory models also tested for interactions between soil quality and the other predictors in all four models. Consistent with expectations, the interaction between soil quality and land area emerged as the most important interaction, and was jointly significant for the case of permanent labor migration in Kenya (p = 0.019). Given the large number of interaction coefficients that were tested for significance as part of this exploratory analysis, these results should not be considered as definitive but instead as a point of departure for future studies. To present the results of the interaction between soil quality and land area, predicted probabilities of permanent labor migration were derived for households with high and low soil quality using mean values of the other predictors from the Kenyan sample (Fig. 3). This reveals that permanent labor migration is low for households with high soil quality and low for land-rich households with low soil quality, but very high for land-poor households with low soil quality.',\n",
       "  'Discussion': \"Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that soil quality is associated with reduced migration in Kenya, particularly for temporary labor migration, and weak evidence that soil quality is associated with increased migration in Uganda, most clearly for permanent non-labor migration. The pattern in Kenya suggests that households respond to low soil quality, and consequently reduced agricultural yields, by sending temporary migrants as a way to generate additional household income. Temporary migration is a common strategy in Kenya (Table 3) that likely has low barriers to entry, potentially explaining how even households with poor soil quality can afford to participate. In contrast in Uganda, the pattern is less clear but the results suggest that low soil quality reduces households' ability to send permanent non-labor migrants for reasons such as marriage and schooling. Due to costs such as housing, school fees and bridewealth, these forms of mobility may have relatively high barriers to entry, perhaps explaining why households with poor soil quality might be excluded.  The divergent results reflect the quite different economic contexts of these two countries and reinforce Blaikie and Brookfield's (1987) claim that land degradation is always contextual. In Kenya, temporary migration is a common livelihood strategy and there are substantial opportunities for agricultural intensification and diversification (Section 3.2). In this context, households with low soil quality can afford to send migrants, with the knowledge that they will be able to profitable invest the wages on their farms. Households with small farms appear to be most affected, consistent with expectations that poor households would be more vulnerable to environmentally-induced migration (Wisner et al., 2004). In Uganda, in contrast, households have access to fewer resources and fewer opportunities for both temporary migration and agricultural intensification. In this context, it appears that soil quality enables costly permanent migrations as a form of capital. This result is consistent with the existence of a poverty trap which restricts participation in both migration and agricultural intensification for Ugandan households (Barrett, 2008), though confirmation of this process will require additional empirical research.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions': 'The findings of this study have important implications for theories of environmentally-induced migration, for research methods in this field, and for development policy in Kenya and Uganda. Regarding theories of environmentally-induced migration, the results contribute to a growing number of empirical studies indicating that while adverse environmental conditions typically increase migration (Section 2.2), local and temporary moves are often most affected, and effects can also occur in the opposite direction. Thus Henry et al. (2004) found that migration could decrease with drought, Halliday (2006) found that migration could decease following a natural disaster, and Massey et al. (2010) found that local moves were most affected by environmental conditions. Similarly, this study finds that temporary moves were most affected in Kenya, and that migration marginally increased with soil quality in Uganda. Together these studies highlight the contextually contingent nature of migration-environment relationships, and suggest that skepticism is warranted for broad narratives that predict large-scale and long-distance displacements due to soil degradation or other forms of local environmental change (e.g., Myers, 1997).\\nRegarding research methods in this field, this study adds to a small number of previous studies which have combined household surveys, environmental data sources and multivariate analyses to examine environmental influences on human migration (Henry et al., 2004;Gray, 2009). This approach addresses the need for a robust, generalizable methodology in this field, where sophisticated empirical applications have lagged significantly behind the high level of interest by academics and policy-makers (Kniveton et al., 2008). Regarding soil quality specifically, empirical research would clearly benefit from additional household surveys that collect matched soil samples, as implemented in the REPEAT project and facilitated by spectroscopic methods of soil analysis (Yamano et al., 2004(Yamano et al., , 2005)). Future efforts should additionally consider collecting subjective reports of soil quality, enabling comparisons between the two data sources (Mairura et al., 2008), as well as repeating soil sampling in the same locations. The latter approach would enable a variety of analyses of how soil quality, livelihood strategies, and household well-being interact over time, including potential feedbacks between soil degradation and migration.\\nFinally, this study also has important implications for development policy in Kenya and Uganda. In Kenya, land-poor households with low soil quality appear to be particularly dependent on labor and temporary migration. This result suggests that expanding opportunities for labor migration, such as through the construction of rural infrastructure (Pender et al., 2006), will likely benefit vulnerable households without leading to rural depopulation. In Uganda, access to chemical fertilizers is very poor (Yamano et al., 2004), and potentially contributes to rural households being caught in a poverty trap. Policies that increase access to chemical fertilizers and other agricultural inputs via targeted subsidies, removal of trade barriers or improvements in infrastructure are needed to increase agricultural productivity and reduce rural poverty (Matsumoto and Yamano, 2009).'}}"

       "{0: {'abstract': \"Migration is at the centre of demographic research on the populationenvironment nexus. Increasing concerns about the impacts of environmental events on human population are fuelling interest on the relationship between migration and environmental change. Using data from the Climate Change Collective Learning and Observatory Network Ghana project, we employ binary logistic regression to examine migration intentions of households in response to major community stressors including climate-related ones. The results indicate that the type of community stressor that affects households most does not differentiate migration intentions in Ghana's forest-savannah transition zone: Even though the majority of the respondents mentioned climate-related events as the stressor that affects them the most, such events do not appear to directly explain migration intentions. However, socio-demographic factors such as age, household size and current migration status are significant predictors of migration intentions, with younger household heads, heads of migrant households and heads of smaller households being relatively more likely to have migration intentions than other household heads. We conclude that migration drivers are multifaceted and deserve further research because even in areas with perceived environmental stress, climate-related events may not be the primary motivation for migration intentions.\",\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"Internal migration is recognized to be an important mechanism through which the spatial distribution of people changes over time (Greenwood 1997). Migration intentions matter in the internal migration literature because intentions are the first step in the actual migration process (Macleod 1996;Van Dalen and Henkens 2008), and intentions have been found to translate into actual migration in most instances (De Jong 2000;Van Dalen et al. 2005). The use of stated preferences such as intentions has been widely used by social demographers, geographers and psychologist as opposed to the revealed preferences approach often used by economists who are interested in the actual movement of people (Borjas 1991;Hatton and Williamson 2004). The focus on internal migration intentions is important because it makes it easy to trace such migrants for follow-up surveys to check whether they have realized their intentions. Studies have shown that intentions are good predictors of actual migration even though some argue that intentions lack credibility (Constant and Massey 2002;Sutton 1998). Recent climate trends and events, and their impacts on communities, are likely to influence people's choices, and migration will be one of numerous options that will be considered.\\nThis study uses migration intentions as a proxy to measure the likelihood of future out-migration in Ghana's forest-savannah transition zone. This method has been chosen because it makes it easy to understand the migration situation in this setting over a period of time. Also, validating the intentions is comparatively easy when the focus is on internal migration rather than international migration. Inferring from the 'new economies of migration' thesis (Lauby and Stark 1988;Stark 1991), households will make migration decisions in environmentally challenged settings based not only on the benefits that households stand to gain from migration but also to minimize risk associated with climate-related events. The means of minimizing risk is easily accessible in developed countries in the form of insurance markets and government programs (Massey et al. 1993), but this is difficult to achieve in some developing countries because of the poor economy or limited governance structures (Mahul and Stutley 2010). A number of developing countries' economies rely heavily on agriculture, but very few of these countries have access to crop insurance (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler 2006). Crop losses due to extreme weather events are a common phenomenon in agriculture, including losses in developing countries. An estimated 70-80 % of the losses are attributable either to a lack of rain or to an excess of moisture (either heavy rain or flooding) (Herbold 2010). Risk diversification in the event of climate-related events among poor farmers is very challenging, and migration is usually one of the numerous strategies that are used by households.\\nIn addition, the structural adjustment policies of the mid-1980s and 1990s, such as the removal of subsidies on fertilizer, health care and other social services, have seriously affected development in many parts of Ghana especially in rural communities. Farmers generally were not able to buy fertilizers to increase their yields and therefore decided to move into non-agriculture sectors with migrant farmers being the most affected population (Amanor and Pabi 2007). Also, as a result of the liberalization of land tenure systems and land reforms in 1990s, there has been increasing land tenure insecurity for women, migrant farmers and young people (Awumbila and Tsikata 2010). In some cases, the longer a settler stays in the community, the more he or she is viewed as a community member and the less restriction that may be imposed on his/her agricultural land use rights (Kasanga and Kotey 2001). However, because of population growth in the transition zone and the high demand for land for agriculture, it is usually difficult for non-indigenes to have less restriction on land use. Indigenes impose rules on share-cropping that typically restrict non-indigenes from cultivating economic plants such as cocoa and palm trees on their land since that takes a longer time to mature and also brings about complications when the indigene wants to take the land away from the non-indigene (Adjei-Nsiah 2006).\\nOverall, internal migration trends in sub-Saharan Africa are significant. Ruralurban migration accounted for roughly half of urban growth in Africa between the 1960s and 1990s (Zachariah and Conde 1981;Kelley 1991;Lall and Shalizi 2006). It is estimated that 36 % of sub-Saharan Africa's population lives in urban areas (World Urbanization Prospects: The 2011 Revision). An estimated 50-80 % of rural households in sub-Saharan Africa have at least one migrant member (DFID 2004). Considerable demographic literature on internal migration in sub-Saharan Africa discusses the characteristics of people who are more likely to move (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) 2005; Byass et al. 2003;Gibson and Gurmu 2012). However, these findings may not extend to the relationship between climate-related events and the intention to migrate. The impact of climate-related events could bring about varying results at the household level. This is an issue that affects everyone and receives very complex responses from both poor and rich households based on the resources available to them and the type of climate event that is being experienced (Foresight 2011). Increasing concerns about the impact of climaterelated environmental events on human population further fuel the interest on how to explain the relationship between environmental change and migration (UNFPA 2009;Van der Geest 2011).\\nMigration has a long-standing tradition in Ghana. Every ethnic group in Ghana claims to have migrated from somewhere else within the region to its current location (Anarfi et al., 2003). It is estimated that about 25 % of migratory moves in Ghana are rural-urban (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) 2008). The reasons behind most of these migrations are usually to join a family, to find a better environment and also for economic activities (Songsore 2009;Van der Geest 2011). In West Africa, there are well-established patterns of seasonal migration from the northern regions of countries such as Ghana, Togo, Mali and Burkina Faso to destinations in the south such as cocoa farms (Sharp et al., 2003). These seasonal migrations are influenced by the differences in the ecological zones, as the north is usually dry for most of the year while the southern regions typically experience a substantial wet period throughout the year. As a result, the southern part of Ghana tends to be a net receiver of migrants, and the northern part is known as a net supplier of migrants (GSS 2005). The decision to migrate in some instance is partly the result of the goods, or capital return migrants are able to bring home, which motivate others from their communities to migrate (Kwankye et al. 2009). Females from northern parts of Ghana for instance embark on migration in order to acquire the basic things that will enable them to get married (Opare 2003). Also, one study on north-south migration in Ghana concludes that migration decisions were not ascribed to sudden onset of environmental stress and that environmental pull of more easily accessible arable land in the south appears to be at least as important as environmental push (Van der Geest 2011). Overall, current research suggests that socio-demographic and economic factors are the dominant drivers of internal migration.\\nIn recent times, internal migration has been used as a livelihood strategy in environmentally vulnerable rural communities in Ghana (Kwankye et al. 2009). The relationship between environmental events and migration has been established empirically in other contexts-although the relationship is not a linear one-and varies according to other migration 'push' and 'pull' factors. In southwest Mexico, declining rainfall has been associated with rising migration to the United States, since many rural communities depend on rain-fed agriculture (Munshi 2003); however, a second study in the drought-prone Mexican states of Zacatecas and Durango found the opposite: that decreasing rainfall correlated with lower rates of international migration (Kniveton et al. 2008). Findings from studies in Burkina Faso (Beauchemin and Schoumaker 2005) and Mali (Findley 1994) revealed that droughts in the 1970s and 1980s were associated with decreases in international, long-distance migration, while short-distance migration to larger agglomerations increased during drought years. However, climate-related stressors are just one of the stressors people in the West Africa region experience. There are no studies on how climate-related stressors as part of the general stressors of a community affect migration intentions. Examining climate-related stressors as part of the general stressors will help policy makers to understand the contribution of climate-related stressors to internal migration and to develop policies that will address the challenges of climate-related stressors.\\nThis paper examines internal migration intentions of respondents in two rural agricultural communities (Bouko and Bofie-Banda) in the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana where their source of livelihood is affected by environmental stress. In this paper, we address three research questions: (1) Do household heads in the forestsavannah transition zone perceive climate-related events as a major community stressor? (2) Do household heads in the forest-savannah transition zone perceive climate-related events as the stressor of greatest concern? (3) Are household heads who perceive climate-related events as the stressor of greatest concern more likely to intend to migrate than household heads that do not? The two communities provide different environmental contexts in which to study migration intentions. Bouko is located in a dry, semi-deciduous forest, while Bofie-Banda is located in a wooded savannah grassland (Fig. 1). The Bouko community has in recent times experienced the establishment of stone quarry companies in the community, which serve as an alternative source of livelihood for local people while there is no such development in Bofie-Banda. Buoku is also located on the main Sunyani-Wenchi highway, which makes it possible for farmers to sell their produce to the travelling public. Bofie-Banda on the other hand is located about 17 km from the Wenchi-Sampa road but has currently seen a lot of vehicular movements because of the construction of the Bui power dam which is about 22 km from the community. In terms of marketing of farm produce, people in Bofie-Banda transport their produce to either Nsawkaw or Wenchi for sale.\\nWhy focus on the forest-savannah transition zone?\\nIn terms of agriculture, Ghana has five distinct agroecological zones, namely rainforest, forest-savannah transition, guinea savannah, Sudan savannah and coastal savannah. These zones are characterized by distinct rainfall regimes and as a result support specific crops. The forest-savannah transition zone in Ghana has been the focus of policies addressing environmental issues over the past two decades because it is particularly vulnerable to climate-related environmental events that negatively impact agriculture (Afikorah-Danquah 2009). The forest-savannah transition zone is one of the food baskets of Ghana and has been a major destination for migrants from the comparatively arid Sudan savannah regions of Ghana (GSS 2005). There are two different vegetation characteristics in the transition zone, and so communities in the region experience different types of environmental conditions.\\nEcologically, the southern part of the transition zone largely comprises dry semi-deciduous forest, while the northern part consists of a mosaic of gallery forests and forest patches in more-or-less wooded savannah grassland. The soils in the forest-savannah transition zone are generally sandy in texture and have low effective water retention capacity, and nutrients leach easily if not well managed (Adjei-Nsiah 2006). This has resulted in soil impoverishments in some parts of the region, particularly where the soils are light textured surface horizons with clay pans appearing in shallow depths (MOFA 1998). Against these challenges, a recent study in the region has shown widespread presence of highly fertile anthropogenic dark earth soils, similar to Amazonian terra preta, yet subject to continuing production and use (Leach et al. 2012). The little known practice of soil enrichment, though largely absent from common narratives of land degradation in the transition zone, points to a long history of relatively sophisticated indigenous farming practices.\\nHowever, the population in the transition zone has grown over the years, and this has equally had an impact on the land. According to the 2000 population census, the transition zone had a population density of 46 people per square kilometre, which is the third lowest in Ghana in terms of regions. However, population densities are unevenly distributed within the transition zone, with a much higher population density of 109 people per square kilometre in the forest portion of the area and a thin population density of 22 people per square kilometre in the savannah portion (GSS 2005). This presupposes that there is widely available land in the savannah portion to migrant farmers from the northern part of Ghana at relatively cheap terms but in a difficult environment to succeed (Amanor and Pabi 2007). Farmers, especially in the forest portion of the transition zone, could no longer practice bush-fallow system of farming because of limited land (Codjoe and Bilsborrow 2011). This condition presents farmers in the transition zone with limited arable lands for their farming activities, which has serious implications for food security in Ghana as a whole.\\nEnvironmental trends are exacerbating the already challenging economic, social and health issues confronting the populations in the forest-savannah transition zone and are obstacles to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of reducing poverty by half by the year 2015 (Adjei-Nsiah 2006). According to the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) report on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment in 2008, cocoa production will be seriously affected by the impact of climatic events and the ramification of this on the social and economic life of individuals, communities and Ghana as a whole will be very significant. Cocoa is a major cash crop in Ghana and a significant contributor to its Gross National Product (GSS 2008). Initial qualitative study in Buoku indicates that farmers in the community used to cultivate cocoa on a larger scale four decades ago but because of the irregular rainfall and rampant bush fires, few of the farmers currently have cocoa plantation. The irregular trend of rainfall in the area does not support cocoa production, which was formerly a major cash crop for the people.\\nToday, environmental change, including climate-related events, presents a new threat to human survival and a new situation for migration (Adger et al. 2001). However, there is still little understanding of how climate-related environmental events will contribute to migration, net of the traditional determinants of migration. Ghana continues to experience significant rural-urban migration (GSS 2005), although the rate of migration has declined over the years, and it is also lower compared to many African countries. Environmental events could be spurring the increase in rural-urban migration, at least in part, as members of agricultural communities are moving into non-agricultural settings in search of alternative sources of livelihood (Marchetta 2008;Van der Geest 2011).\",\n",
       "  'Climate-related events and internal migration intentions': \"The relationship between climate-related events and migration intentions is complex. It is difficult to distinguish individuals for whom environmental factors are the sole motivation for migration. In other words, the fact that people are migrating in most cases cannot be solely attributed to environmental factors. Thus, it is important to consider the general stressors people go through in a place and to find out whether the type of stressor experienced differentiates migration intentions. Despite these complexities, Myers (2002) predicts that there will be more than 200 million environmental refugees by 2050. His article was cited by a number of subsequent publications as the best estimate of the number of people who will be displaced due to the adverse effects of climate-related events (Friends of the Earth 2007; Christian Aid 2007;Stern 2007;Global Humanitarian Forum 2009). However, this estimate has been criticized as 'guesswork' owing to the assumptions of its methodology (Castles 2002(Castles , 2011;;Brown 2008;Gemenne 2011;Foresight 2011). There are several factors that drive migration, and climatic events are just one of these. Also, because climatic events are linked to the environmental, economic and socio-political factors that also drive migration, it is difficult to identify individuals for whom climatic factors are the sole reason for migrating. It is important to take into account other factors when investigating whether people in low-income countries will migrate as a result of climate-related events.\\nThus, environmental factors cannot be easily disentangled from the rest of the social, economic and political factors and processes leading to out-migration (Lonergan 1998). With the exception of sudden environmental disasters, migration is just one among several possible responses and adaptations to environmental changes (Adger et al. 2007). People's subjective view and perception of climate hazards and their own vulnerability to climate variability are other factors related to migration decisions (Izazola et al. 1998;Hunter 2005). It is, however, difficult to tell whether such decisions are made based on climate-related stressors or the social and economic challenges that people have to grapple with. Psychologically, people who have experienced a particular event over a long period of time may perceive it as a 'normal' event and thus may not turn to migration as a response (Kasperson and Kasperson 2005). In other words, people may develop a psychological thinking that enables them to cope with environmental hardships. The intention to migrate is more likely to arise as a result of the social and economic difficulties that are exacerbated by climate-related environmental events. Therefore, it is important to examine these other stressors together with climate-related stressors to see whether they yield different effects on migration intentions.\\nEnvironmental events such as floods and droughts can serve as an immediate push while long-term changes such as desertification can lead to a decline in living standards that increases the cost of staying versus leaving (Adamo 2003). In sum, the severity of environmental stresses can force people to adapt to adverse situations by employing many kinds of adaptation measures (Codjoe et al. 2012 andCodjoe andOwusu 2011). Internal migration is a livelihood strategy for many households in rural Ghana as a result of poor agricultural yields (GSS 2005). For example, rural families often encourage young men and women to migrate to the urban centres in order to send remittances home and to reduce household size (Van der Geest 2004). In other cases, rural farmers migrate from the north of the country to the transitional zone, where arable land is less scarce (Van der Geest 2011). We suspect that climate-related environmental events will increase migration from affected environments by those who have the ambition or resources to move and as a result may leave most of these areas with particularly vulnerable (or 'trapped') populations.\\nThe risk of being affected by environmental impacts is the interaction between climate-related events and the underlying social vulnerability of the population. Social vulnerability in this sense is viewed as the socio-demographic characteristics of households such as age, household size and migration status that make them relatively vulnerable to climate-change-related events. Also, migration decisions in response to climatic impacts are likely to be influenced by community stressors. To better understand these associations, this study focuses on salient stressors of households including climate-related ones and how these differently influence migration intentions in rural agricultural communities in the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana.\",\n",
       "  'Data and method': \"The data for the study are part of series of data collected by members of the Climate Change Collective Learning and Observatory Network Ghana (CCLONG) project in the two communities in the transition zone from 2007 to 2009. Two of the authors were part of the CCLONG project team. 1 The CCLONG Project had four main objectives: (1) to assess perceptions of climate change and other threats among farmers, extension agents, researchers and policy makers as well as determinants of adaptive capacity and decision-making for adaptation; (2) adjust climate forecasts, carbon measurements and modelling to place-specific needs; (3) encourage social learning and risk communication for adaptation and resilience; and (4) identify land use and management practices, socio-economic strategies and institutional arrangements that enhance carbon uptake and storage (mitigation) and contribute to more resilient livelihoods and ecosystems (adaptation).\\nThe CCLONG team conducted a household survey in the two selected communities (Bouko and Bofie-Banda) in 2009. The communities were selected because they both fall in the forest-savannah transition zone but have different environmental histories that have over the years influenced the type of crops that are cultivated by farmers. Both communities used to have forest vegetation with the majority of farmers cultivating cocoa, maize and rice. However, changes in rainfall trends over the past four decades, coupled with droughts causing bush fires, have influenced agricultural activities in the transition zone. For example, farmers in Bofie-Banda have stopped producing maize, which is generally a staple food and a major cash crop in the transition zone, because the pattern of rainfall in the area did not support maize cultivation anymore. Additionally, the CCLONG team had indepth information of the communities because they had been collecting qualitative data in the communities for over 2 years. Survey respondents were randomly selected using a household listing completed by students of the University for Development Studies (Tamale, Ghana) in 2008. A total of 200 households representing more than 50 % of households in the communities were selected and visited for the study. All the 200 selected households participated in the study. Approximately 100 households were interviewed in each of the communities. Also, the households in the study communities are homogenous in character with about 98 % of them being farmers. However, the establishment of stone quarry companies in Bouko in 2010 could serve as alternative source of livelihood to the people.\\nThe questionnaire was administered to heads of household. Household heads were chosen because of the role they play in decision-making in the study settings. They typically have the final say in major household decisions. There were instances in some of the qualitative studies in the communities where household heads did not practically contribute anything to household income but were recognized by household members as the ones responsible for making household financial decisions. Household heads are thus held in high esteem, and issues confronting families are usually discussed at that level before it is taken to higher levels like the chief palace in instances where there is no compromise among the parties. With regard to migration decision-making processes, individual household members who have the intent to migrate typically need the approval of the head of the household to be able to embark on a good journey. Further, in order to measure the social vulnerability of households to environmental events, a combination of household head characteristics and general household information was used. These included the household head's age, sex, educational level, marital status, as well as the present migration status of household, household size and household income. These factors are influential in amplifying or reducing overall vulnerability to hazards (Blaikie 1994;Hewitt 1997).\\nThe validity of these variables is tested in the study, but they are assumed to be relevant to this study for the reasons outlined below. Firstly, the age of household head determines the security of younger household members in times of climaterelated hazards. Older household heads may not migrate in most instances because of the attachments they have to their communities as compared to younger household heads. Thus, older household heads preserve the traditions of the household and help in the upbringing of children even if some members are going to migrate. Younger household heads may in most instances migrate with the entire family as compared to older household heads who may select some members of the household to migrate. Also, because of the land tenure system in the area and the power that is given to male household heads, female-headed households may not have access to alternative sources of livelihood in a community where men control most of the resources. Individual members in female-headed households are therefore more likely to suffer as a result of climate-related events compared to households headed by males. In addition, the educational level of the head of the household plays an important role in the welfare of the household and also determines the level of information available to the household and their capacity to prepare towards climate-related events. All things being equal, household heads with higher level of education are expected to be more knowledgeable than household heads with lower level of education in times of climate-related events because education provides people with a lot of options in times of difficulties.\\nSecondly, the marital status of the household head also helps to determine the level of vulnerability of the household. People who are married tend to have more extended relations coming to their aid in times of climate-related events than those who are not married and so may be limited to just their immediate family. Those who are not married on the other hand could easily migrate without having to worry about kin relations like those who are married. Thus, unmarried people are able to take quick decisions in times of climate-related hazards in comparison with married people. The size of the household also determines how the household will be able to manage in times of climate-related events. The larger the household size, the more vulnerable they may be compared to smaller household size in times of a disaster because the needs of a larger household will be difficult to provide for compared to a smaller one where just a few people have to be attended to. On the other hand, larger households might be able to more easily diversify their income by sending one of their members elsewhere for cash labour without losing essential household labour. Finally, the current migration status of the household head determines how attached the household is to the community and the resources that the household could enjoy in the community. All things being equal, non-migrant households have greater access to land and kin relations than migrant households and so may be less affected by climate-related events compared to migrant households. However, when a migrant is married to an indigenous person, he or she stands to benefit from the properties owned by the partner. There are also instances where the length of stay of a migrant in a community could give him/her similar privileges similar to those of non-migrants. Also, income plays a major role in the migration decision process. In an environmentally challenged setting, household income may help facilitate the migration process in a household. Households that have the financial resources will be able to sponsor members to embark on migration while those who do not have the financial resources may resort to other ways of coping with the situation.\",\n",
       "  'Dependent variable': \"The dependent variable in the study was migration intentions. Household heads were asked, 'Do you intend to move from this community in the next 5 years?' The question sought to identify household heads who intended to migrate from the community and stay in their new location continuously for 6 months and beyond. Households that indicated 'yes' were those who have the intention to migrate while those who said otherwise were classified as those who have no migration intentions.\",\n",
       "  'Independent variable': \"The independent variable used in the model was the stressor that household heads indicated affected them most in the study communities. First, household heads with assistance from other members of the household listed all the major stressors that affect them in the community. All respondents were prompted once with regard to this particular question. Second, still with inputs from other household members, the stressors in an order of how they should be addressed were ranked. Third, household heads scored the severity of the stressor. The study used cowpea seeds for the severity score because some of the respondents were illiterate. Participants scored each stressor with the seeds bearing in mind that the number of seeds placed on a particular stressor is a measure of the severity of that stressor. The scoring ranged from zero to five. A score of zero is an indication that that particular stressor in the community has no impact on the respondents' household while a score of five is an indication that it is a stressor that affects them most. Thus, lower scores relate to no or mild impacts, and higher scores relate to severe impacts on households. The severity of each major community stressor as scored in the household was used in the regression model as the main independent variables. We treated the stressors in the model independently but discussed the stressors as climate-related or nonclimate-related. Thus, irregular rainfall and bush fire were considered as climaterelated stressors. This is because our prior focus group discussions in the communities revealed that individuals in the area perceive irregular rainfall and bush fires as climate-related events.2 \",\n",
       "  'Control variables': \"We controlled for household size, household income, age, sex, marital status, migration status and level of education of household head, which are known to influence internal migration intentions (Anarfi et al. 2003;Kwankye et al. 2009). Age is categorized into four groups in conformity with the classification of youth in rural Ghana as those aged 18 years and above but less than 30 years. Those aged 30-39 and 40-49 years are classified as those in their middle age, while those aged 50 years and above are classified as the elderly in the communities. Marital status is categorized into those married/cohabiting and those not in unions. Education is categorized as those with primary or lower education and those with junior high or higher certificate. There were very few respondents with a secondary or higher education, and so these were combined with those with junior high education. The size of the household was equally categorized into three groupings. We combined single individual households with households with two members because the two may not be very different in how they are affected by climate-related events. We therefore grouped household size into those with: (1) less than three members; (2) three to five member households; and (3) households with six or more members. We classified households of six members as larger households because the current average household size for rural forest in Ghana is approximately five members (GSS 2008).\\nHousehold income was classified into two groups: those who earn an annual household income of GH₵ 2,000, which is approximately equivalent to the annual minimum wage in Ghana, and those who earn above GH₵ 2,000. We grouped household income into two categories because most of the household had an annual income of just a little over GH₵ 1,000 and the maximum household income that was reported was about GH₵ 2,500. Income levels in the study area are low, and there is little variation in income among households. However, migrant households typically have higher income than non-migrant households because they put the piece of land available to them into maximum use by applying fertilizer and other chemicals on their crops to ensure that they get enough harvest to be able to achieve their migration objectives. With regard to sex, we distinguished between households that had females as their head and those that had males as their head because of some cultural privileges that individuals enjoy in the transition zone based on their gender. Finally, we classified current migration status of households into those who are currently migrants in the community and those who are not. We took into consideration respondents' place of birth and whether they are natives of the community or not. Generally, non-migrants or indigenous people of the community have access to agriculture lands that can only be acquired by migrants through leasing, marriage or a long period of stay in the community (Adjei-Nsiah 2006).\",\n",
       "  'Analytic approach': 'To examine what type of climate-related environmental events may trigger internal migration intentions, a binary logistic regression was employed to handle the dichotomous dependent variable. Two models were run for the study. The first model examined the relationship between stressors and migration intentions in the transition zone. The second model examined how households who scored climaterelated stressors as the most severe differ in migration intentions from those who scored other stressors highest controlling for covariates. The level of significance for interpreting the results is p \\\\ 0.05.',\n",
       "  'Results': '',\n",
       "  'Descriptive statistics': \"Table 1 shows the distribution of major community stressors in the forest-savannah transition zone in 2009. The results indicate that household heads in the forestsavannah transition zone are experiencing quite a number of challenges. Climaterelated events (irregular rainfall and bush fire) are among the major stressors mentioned by household heads. Of the 200 sampled households, more than twothirds (70 %) of the respondents indicated that irregular rainfall is a major stressor in the transition zone. In addition, 26 % out of the 200 sampled households mentioned poverty as a major stressor, while 13 and 20 % mentioned poor health services and unemployment, respectively. With regard to education, respondents were concerned about poor formal educational attainment in the community. Other stressors mentioned, such as land disputes, teenage pregnancy, stealing and gross disrespect of elders by the youth, are not shown in Table 1.\\nIn terms of ranking of the community stressors, more than half (51 %) of households ranked irregular rainfall as the most concerned stressor followed by unemployment (22 %) and then poverty (16 %). The least ranked community stressor among the seven is poor health services. In scoring the stressors in terms of severity, irregular rainfall had the highest average severity score of 3.7, followed by bush fire (3.4) and poor soil fertility (3.2). Even though unemployment was the second highest ranked stressor in the communities, its severity score is lower than bush fire and poor soil fertility, which were ranked fifth and sixth, respectively. We argue that it is the severity of the stressors that creates problems for households and the climate-related variables (irregular rainfall and bush fire) received higher severity scores. The intention to migrate from the communities in the next 5 years came up strongly among the respondents. Table 2 shows that more than half (54 %) of the respondents had intention to migrate in the next 5 years. Household heads in the study communities (where the average age was 41.4 years) are, on average, younger than the national average age (46.3 years) for rural Ghana (GSS 2008). There are more male household heads than female household heads in the transition zone, and this is consistent with national statistics where about 71 % of household heads are males (GSS 2008). There are very low levels of education in the study communities. A little over half (51 %) of the respondents had attained junior high school or senior high school education with the remaining having attained primary or lower education. These low levels of education will make respondents less competitive in the formal sector of the economy, and so they may be limited to the informal sector, which does not provide much security for households' well-being in times of climate-related hazards. As expected, nearly two-thirds (64 %) of household heads were married or cohabiting, while the remaining were not part of a union. Household heads are supposed to lead a responsible life and are expected in most rural settings in Ghana to be individuals who are married and command some respect in the community.\\nIn addition, on average, households have approximately five members, which is higher than the national average of 4.1 for rural forest areas but a little lower than the national average of 5.4 members for rural savannah zones (GSS 2008). Generally, income levels are low in the transition zone. Nearly half (48 %) of the respondents in the communities had an annual income below the national minimum wage. Poverty is pronounced in rural Ghana, and about a quarter (25 %) of the population of Ghana lives below the poverty line (GSS 2005). In addition, the current migration status of the household often determines how decisions regarding migration are made. For current migrant households, they could have migration intentions when their expectations at place of destination are not met. This is because, currently, migrant household heads may not have so much attachment to the community compared to those who are non-migrants. That said currently migrant households are challenged in terms of finance to accomplish such migration intentions. Table 2 indicates that a little over half (52 %) of the respondents are currently non-migrants while the remaining are migrants.\",\n",
       "  'Association between climate-related events and internal migration intentions': \"The bivariate association between the major community stressors as mentioned by household heads and the intention to migrate is examined in Table 3. The results indicate that more than half of the respondents who mentioned some of the community stressors as a concern to them did not have the intention to migrate. Also, on average, over two-fifth of the respondents who did not mention any of the community stressors as a concern to them indicated that they have the intention to migrate. The decision to migrate therefore depends on several factors, and it is difficult to say that people are migrating from a particular community as a result of a single factor. The analysis shows that even in a very diverse environmental setting like the forest-savannah transition zone, where the impact of climate-related events is known to be impacting on people's livelihood (Afikorah-Danquah 2009), quite a number of household heads do not have the intention to migrate. Apart from bush fire, which has a statistical association with migration intentions in the forestsavannah transition zone, none of the other major stressors mentioned by the respondents have statistical association with intention to migrate. Thus, one of the climate-related variables (bush fire) was statistically associated with migration intention at the bivariate level, while irregular rainfall was not. With regard to other explanatory variables, age, marital status, household size and migration status were statistically associated with migration intentions, while sex, level of education and income were not statistically associated with migration intentions. Even though most of the major community stressors were not associated with migration intentions, we sought to find out at the multivariate level whether there is a relationship between most severe stressors and intentions to migrate in the transition zone. Turning to multivariate analyses, the results in Model 1 in Table 4 indicate that the most concerned community stressors only explain about 6 % of the variations in the intention to migrate in the transition zone. In Model 2, however, when the sociodemographic factors are controlled, the model explains about 41 % of the variations in the intention to migrate in the transition zone. This is an indication of the strong role socio-demographic factors play in intentions to migrate in the transition zone. This is not different from other studies on migration where socio-demographic factors played important role in the migration decision process and the type of people who finally migrate (De Jong 2000;Anarfi et al. 2003). Climate-related events are tied to socio-demographic factors in the migration decision process with a higher influence on the intention to migrate emanating from socio-demographic indicators. Also, household heads who mentioned bush fire as the stressor that affects them most in the transition zone are significantly more likely to report migration intentions (Model 1). This implies that a unit increase in household's perceived severity score of bush fire will lead to an increase in migration intentions in the household by 0.032. Bush fire is associated with drought in the transition zone, and the gradual changes in the seasonal nature of agriculture in the transition zone as a result of the occurrence of some of these events may render respondents unemployed for some period of the year. Household heads affected by bush fire are more likely to migrate to other places where they can have some employment. The association between bush fire as a stressor that affects households most and migration intentions does not hold after controlling for household heads' sociodemographic factors (Model 2). Model 2 includes socio-demographic characteristics to ascertain whether the associations in Model 1 are robust. Once socio-demographic factors are controlled, there is no significant association between any of the climate-related stressors that affect household heads most and the intention to migrate in the forest-savannah transition zone. Unemployment as a most concerned stressor in the forest-savannah transition zone predicts migration intentions at this point. The results indicate that a unit increase in household heads' perceived severity score of unemployment will result in an increase in migration intentions by 0.380. Non-migrant households are significantly less likely to report migration intentions compared to migrant households. Household heads who are aged 40-49 years are significantly more likely to have migration intentions in their household compared to those aged 20-29 years (Model 2).\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions': \"Migration intentions are influenced by social, economic, demographic and environmental factors. In this study, rainfall is essential for the livelihood of the study populations, which depend on rain-fed agriculture. Environmental events challenge people's livelihoods, which are directly linked to their social and economic well-being. The complex nature of these relationships demands a thorough investigation of the environmental, socio-demographic and economic factors that trigger migration intentions. To understand how community stressors including climate-related stressors predict migration intentions, we considered stressors that affect respondents most in the study communities, the sociodemographic and economic situation of the people, and the agroecological area in which they are located.\\nOur results indicate that the majority of household heads in the forest-savannah transition zone perceive climate-related events as their most pressing stressor. This is so because agriculture, which is the main livelihood of the people, depends on rainfall. Irregular rainfall and bush fires will therefore make it difficult for them to harvest enough from their farming activities. This is consistent with other studies in the transition zone that indicate a dramatic change in the rainfall pattern in the area (Asiamah et al. 2000;Adjei-Nsiah 2006). Also, household heads in the transition zone perceive climate-related events as the most salient stressors confronting them. More than half (56.5 %) of the respondents mentioned climate-related events as the stressor that affects them most. We equally found that more than half of the respondents in the transition zone had the intention to migrate which could potentially impact food production in the region-although the present study did not probe where migrants planned to move (which could include, for example, other rural areas within the region, urban centres or returning to their communities of origin in northern Ghana). The transition zone has some of the major food markets in Ghana because of high food production in the area. The Techiman food market for instance is patronized by people from neigbouring countries such as Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. Also, food produced in the transition zone, especially yam and maize, is transported to other parts of Ghana by market women. This has helped us to address food shortage situations in some parts of northern Ghana, especially during the dry periods in the north when food production is very low. Thus, the migration of farmers from the transition zone will have major consequences for food security and requires some urgent attention from policy makers to address what is driving these people to have such intentions.\\nHowever, apart from unemployment in our study, the other type of stressors that affect people most, including climate-related events, does not differentiate migration intentions in the transition zone after controlling for socio-demographic and economic factors that influence migration decisions. In fact, socio-demographic factors were found to be the main predictors of intentions to migrate in the forestsavannah transition zone. Thus, older household heads in the transition zone significantly report lower migration intentions compared to younger household heads. This is consistent with the migration literature where people in younger age groups are most likely to embark on migration compared to those in older age groups (Hughes and McCormick 1985;Lam 2006;GSS 2008;White and Subedi 2008).\\nIn addition, non-migrant household heads in the study area are significantly less likely to report migration intentions than migrant household heads because of the attachment non-migrants have to their community and the resources available to them. In the forest-savannah transition zone for instance, non-migrants are the custodians of the farmland, and so they rent the land to migrant households based on share-cropping arrangements (Amanor 2002;Adjei-Nsiah 2006). The sharecropping practice in this setting is in two forms-Abusa and Abunu. Abusa was formerly the dominant share arrangement, which was based on division into thirds. Under this arrangement, one could be employed to weed and manage an already established farm or plantation in exchange for a third of the yield. Also, an abusa tenant can gain access to land and in return provide the landlord a third of the yield. This system has been replaced with the half share system (abunu) in which a landlord commands a half share as land has become scarcer. The landlords, who are mostly the indigenous people, enter into share contracts with settler farmers in order to make maximum benefit from their resources and also to have control over the land. In this regard, non-migrant households do not go through so much difficulty because they rely on what migrant households will harvest at the end of the farming season (World Bank 2003). Migrants on the other hand exert a lot of pressure on the land in order to have good harvest under the share-cropping system, and if they are not able to harvest much, they are likely to migrate to a different place (Amanor 1993;Codjoe and Bilsborrow 2012). It is also important to mention that migrants are typically less tied to their communities of residence and thus can more easily decide to embark on migration than non-migrants (Nogle 1996;Levitt 2004).\\nUnemployment is the only community stressor that predicts migration intentions because of the limited options in employment in the study communities. The other salient community stressors mentioned by household heads, including climaterelated events, do not differentiate migration intentions probably as a result of people's perceptions about the efficacy of coping resources that they may be using to address these challenges, which have not been explored in this study. As already mentioned, the share-cropping system in the transition zone may be a valuable resource to non-migrants in times of climate-related events but may make year-onyear livelihood outcomes for migrant households difficult. The resources available to non-migrants may help them cope with the situation while migrants are most likely to migrate because of inadequate resources. Also, the growth of the population in the forest portion of the transition zone means that individual households may not have large land tracts to rent some out to migrant households. In this regard, if farmers will have to cultivate different types of crops on a piece of land because of the unpredictable nature of the rains, then migrant households will be limited in their options because they will not have access to enough land to do this. The practice of multicropping generally has been used in some parts of Ghana as a strategy to diversify risk and also overcome land constraints. However, migrants typically do not practice multicropping because the strategy requires more than one growing season and it is difficult to pursue under the share-cropping rules.\\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that migrant households are more likely to have migration intentions than non-migrant households in Ghana's forest-savannah transition zone. The contribution of migrants to their host communities is, however, very significant. In the agricultural sector for instance, migrants play a crucial role in providing farm labour (Fisher et al. 2004) and also contribute significantly to food production. With the system of land tenure in Africa coupled with recent climatic impacts, the contribution of migrants to the agricultural sector could be negatively affected. Migrants may not have enough land to undertake farming, and their productivity could also be low because of the impact of climate change on crops. In this sense, the direction of migrants may be towards urban places where they could get alternative jobs that are different from agriculture. On the other hand, our study suggests established indigenous people are more likely to stay because of their attachment to the community and the resources they have. However, the extent to which these people will be committed to stay in the community has not been rigorously tested in this study, and this is an area that needs to be examined in future studies. For instance, when there is high demand on the same family land from the youngest generation of household members, it will be difficult for everybody to receive a fair share. In such situations, will some members consider migrating? And, if so, what will be the implications for food production in the transition zone? These are critical issues that need research attention.\\nThe forest-savannah transition zone has high rates of in-migrants and outmigrants. The study also reveals high migration intentions in the area. It is, however, not clear whether this trend of migration intentions pertains specifically to the communities examined or whether this is symptomatic of wider trends within the transition zone more broadly. It is also unclear from the current study whether members of established households other than the household head are engaging in migration-another issue that deserves further research and could potentially impact the livelihoods of household members who stay behind. In short, our study finding that socio-demographic factors are greater predictors of migration intentions than whether households report being affected by climate-related events supports existing research that suggests that climate change's impact on migration trends will be influenced by existing drivers of migration, including economic and social ones (Foresight 2011).\"},\n",

       "  'INTRODUCTION': \"Situated in the heart of the West African Sahel, the Republic of Niger covers an area of 1.267.000 kilometers 2 . It is bordered by Mali and Burkina Faso in the West, by Nigeria and Benin in the South, by Chad in the East, and by Libya and Algeria in the North (UNDP, 2006). Although it is the fourth-largest country in Africa, 65 per cent of its territory lies within the Sahara Desert and is largely uninhabited. From the North to the South, the arid desert changes to semi-arid savannah and then to a narrow tropical zone. Niger used to share the Lake Chad in the Southeast with Nigeria and Chad (Grote and Warner, 2009). However, the lake completely dried out in the territory of Niger. The country consists of eight main regions: Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey (including the capital of Niger, Niamey), Tahoua, Tillabe´ri, and Zinder. The most food insecure areas are the agro-pastoral regions of Maradi and Tillabe´ri and the pastoral regions of Agadez, Tahoua and Zinder (USAID, 2005).\\nThe population of Niger is estimated to be 14 million (CIA, 2008). The most densely populated regions are Maradi and Dosso that correspond to the narrow band of arable land in the South. The less densely populated areas correspond to the two largest regions, Agadez (mostly desert) and Diffa. 86 per cent of the population live in rural areas. Urbanisation has increased from 13 per cent in 1977 to 16.3 per cent in 2001, mainly due to demographic growth and rural exodus. According to future projections, an increase of 30 per cent is expected by the year 2020 (UNDP, 2006). In May 2004, a National Urban Development Strategy was prepared to reduce regional disparities and enhance the urban structure (IMF, 2005). People in Niger rely on the environment on daily basis, since 90 per cent of the labour force is engaged in farming, cattle herding and fishing (CIA, 2008).\\nWith respect to the Human Development Index, Niger ranks the last out of 182 countries with an average life expectancy of 50.8 years at birth (UNDP, 2009). Forty per cent of children suffer from malnutrition and growth deficiency. Furthermore, less than one child out of four completes her ⁄ his primary studies (UNICEF, 2007).\\nEconomically, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world; its economy relies on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits, which not everyone of its inhabitants has access to, since they are mainly concentrated in the Agadez region in the North. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). In December 2005, Niger received 100 per cent multilateral debt relief from IMF, where approximately US$ 86 million in debts to the IMF were written off. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of Niger is US$ 700 and the real growth rate 5.9 per cent (CIA, 2008).\\nUnfavourable climatic conditions, lack of resources, a poor economic growth, a high level of malnutrition, insufficient basic structures, weak industrial performance, demographic growth and weak performance of social sectors make Niger one of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC); half of the government's budget is covered by external aid (UN and Government of Niger, 2005).\\nNiger has been suffering from numerous environmental problems, such as droughts, soil degradation, the shrinking of Lake Chad, the Niger River problems (including water pollution, the spreading of the water hyacinth, an invasive alien species), siltation and drying out), deforestation, and sand intrusion. This paper examines the impact of environmental problems on migration within and outside Niger, relying mainly on expert interviews 1 in Niger and migrant and non-migrant questionnaires. The main research question that the paper addresses is: How does environmental deterioration in Niger contribute to the migration decision of the people migrating within and emigrating from the country elsewhere? The research was conducted as part of the Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-FOR) research project, co-financed by the European Commission -Sixth Framework Programme. The paper traces the economic mechanism through which environmental factors in Niger have an impact on migration. It highlights the outcomes of the field visit in Niger, showing the extent to which the environmental damage in Niger influences the economic situation of people, and in turn makes them migrate. In section 2, the topic ''Environmental Migration'' is discussed, referring to the various estimations of current and potential environmental migrants worldwide. In section 3, a general comparison is run between environmental and economic migration. Section 4 sheds light on the deteriorating environmental conditions in the Sub-Saharan African Region and section 5 narrows down the analysis, focusing particularly on the main environmental problems in the Republic of Niger. Section 6 gives an overview of migration processes in Niger, followed by section 7 that summarizes the field visit run in the country. In section 8, the detailed fieldwork findings on environmental migration in Niger are demonstrated and broken down into the outcomes of the expert interviews and the filled out questionnaires with migrants and non-migrants. Finally, section 9 concludes, provides policy recommendations and lessons learned and suggestions for future research on the topic ''environmental migration''.\",\n",
       "  'ENVIRONMENTAL MIGRATION AS A RESEARCH TOPIC': \"In the migration context, environmental change is a relatively new research area. Recently, there have been growing concerns that environmental changes will play an important role in the decision to migrate, since environmental degradation is a threat to many people, at least those who rely on environmental services in their livelihoods, food security, employment, such as farmers and cattle herders.\\nThe estimates of the number of people who have been and will be displaced or forced to migrate this century have varied among publications of different academics, international organizations and advocacy groups (Afifi and Warner, 2008). According to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC, 2003), environmental refugees exceeded those displaced by war. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR, 2002) estimated people around the world who have fled because of floods, famine and other environmental factors, at 24 million, exceeding hereby the number of all other refugees; and Klaus Toepfer from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) expected the number of environmental migrants to reach 50 million by the end of the year 2010 (Boano, et al., 2008). While the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) expects the number to reach 150 million by the year 2050, the Almeria Statement (1994) estimates 135 million people to be negatively affected by desertification and droughts. Norman Meyers (2005) states that there are already 200 million environmental migrants and the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (Stern, 2008) mentions that there will likely be 200 million environmental displaced people by 2050. Nicholls (2004) expects 200 million environmental migrants by 2080, whereas the Friends of Earth ( 2007) expects the same number by 2050 already, including 1 million in Small Island States. On the regional level, UNEP expects in Africa alone 50 million environmental migrants by 2060 (Boano et al., 2008). Christian Aid (2007) classifies the expected environmental migrants by breaking down its predicted number of approx. 0.9 billion people by 2050 to 250 million people affected by droughts, floods and hurricanes and 645 million by dams and other development projects. Steiner (2008) does not provide a concrete figure or number but states that ''many experts argue that large numbers of people are already on the move, with millions more expected to follow as evidence of climate change mounts''.\\nMost of these estimates are highly speculative and have been criticized by various authors (Black et al., 2008), especially when considering the lack of field work on environmental migration. Most of the studies have assumed that migration reflects a failure to cope with the environmental problems, whereas in reality, migration responses are the result of much more complex behavioral decisions, and migration itself ranges from seasonal to temporary and permanent, and varies from local to national and international moves (Leighton, 2009).\",\n",
       "  'ENVIRONMENTAL VERSUS ECONOMIC MIGRATION': \"There has been a huge controversy among scientists and scholars on the extent to which the environmental migrants can be distinguished from economic migrants whose decision to migrate is somehow affected by environmental degradation. One of the first advanced classifications was that of ''environmental refugees'' defined as ''those forced to flee environmental danger and in need for international protection'', just as political refugees (El-Hinnawi, 1985;Myers, 1997). Nevertheless, since the global 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees which took place 1951 in Geneva and which binds governments to protect refugees is not legally applicable to those people affected by environmental problems or natural disasters, the term ''environmental refugees'' remains controversial (Castles, 2002;Leighton, 2006). Moreover, using this term could be at the expenses of political refugees who might be subject to death or torture.\\nAs an alternative, numerous terms have been used in different publications to shed light on the category of people affected by and fleeing environmental problems, such as environmental migrants, environmentally displaced persons, environmentally-induced population movements, environmental induced migrants, environmental emergency migrants, environmentally forced migrants, environmentally motivated migrants, eco-migrants, ecological refugees, envirogees, climate migrants, climate refugees and climigrants. (for example, see IOM, 1992;UNHCR, 2002;Black et al., 2008;Renaud et al., 2007;Renaud et al., 2008;Leighton, 2006;Wood, 2001;and Bronen, 2008).\\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM, 2007) defines the ''environmental migrants'' as ''those persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad''.\\nIn most of the definitions, the economic factor can act as the mechanism through which environmental degradation leads to migration. When talking about livelihood, one cannot exclude food security, income, employment, which are all economic factors that the existence of the affected populations depends on. Nevertheless, it remains very tricky to find out the extent to which pure environmental problems contribute to the migration decision as compared to other factors, including the social and economic ones, especially when it is not the case of natural disasters, where people usually -as a quick reaction -flee to survive, without having much time to think about their livelihood in the long run. This brings us to the definition tree that was introduced by Renaud et al., (2008) and that distinguishes between environmental emergency migrants (those fleeing the worst of an environmental impact permanently or temporarily, usually in the case of rapid onset hazards, including earthquakes, floods and tsunamis); environmental forced migrants (those who must leave to avoid the worst of environmental deterioration, usually in the case of slow-onset hazards, including water and land degradation); and environmentally motivated migrants (those who may leave a progressively worsening environment as a means of preempting the most severe impacts, usually in the case of progressive loss of ecosystem services, including sea level rise and desertification). This definition tree complies with the intervention of Hugo (1996:107), suggesting that ''the contribution of environmental change to migration can best be viewed along a continuum of voluntary towards more forced migration, with intervening aspects and most migrants falling somewhere in the middle.''\",\n",
       "  'THE DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA': \"The nature in the Sub-Saharan African region is generous, since it provides a wide variety of ecosystems and a huge diversity in plant and animal wildlife. Nevertheless, the region's land resources are highly degraded due to various human activities, such as overgrazing, deforestation, agricultural mismanagement, fuel wood consumption, and urbanization (UNEP, 2002).\\nIt is estimated that the annual loss of agriculture's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amounts to 3 per cent due to land degradation in the region (Grote and Warner, 2009). Irregular and unpredictable weather patterns have hit the region with severe droughts recorded in 1967-73, 1981-83, 1986 ⁄ 87, 1991 ⁄ 92 and 1993 ⁄ 94. The drought of 1991 ⁄ 92 alone led to a 54 per cent decrease in cereal harvest and exposed more than 17 million people to risk starving (Callihan et al., 1994). In the Sahelian zone of Western Africa, the period from 1972-84 was one of the worst on record with regard to droughts; more than 100,000 people died during this period, and more than 750,000 people in Mali, Niger and Mauritania were totally dependent on food aid in 1974 (Wijkman and Timberlake, 1984).\\nA severe drought hit the Sahel zone and extended up the Eastern coast in 2004 and 2005. It had serious impacts including total crop failure which has led to increasing food prices and dependency on food relief. Moreover, severe water shortages and rationing, continued reductions in water quantity and quality, increased conflicts over water resources, and the drying up of some rivers and small reservoirs contributed to death of livestock from hunger, thirst and disease, and increased conflicts over grazing belts (Grote and Warner, 2009).\",\n",
       "  'THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN NIGER': 'This section provides an overview of the main environmental problems in Niger, in order to give a base to the analysis that attempts to link these stressors on the migration in the country. Droughts, soil degradation, the shrinking of Lake Chad, the Niger River problems, deforestation and sand intrusion are problems that the Nigeriens 2 suffer from on daily basis, especially that the majority of the population works in farming, cattle herding and fishing, activities that are highly related to the environment.',\n",
       "  'DROUGHTS': \"One of the earliest droughts in Niger was in 1930; it was called Gendaberi (''big stomach'') and was a general drought that covered the whole country and was followed by a famine period. There are also localised droughts that affect particular areas, where the rainfall is patchy and does not affect all the regions. These localised droughts are currently occurring with increasing frequency. The strongest droughts that affected the entire country were in the years 1973 and 1984. Afterwards, several droughts occurred in the country; according to EM-DAT (2009), the total population affected by the droughts from 1988-1990 was around 2.6 millions. In 2001 and 2005, two strong droughts hit the country, where the total population affected was around 3.6 millions and 3 millions, respectively. Nowadays, farmers and cattle herders are still suffering from the consequences of these droughts. At the same time, there is a steady degradation of the soil and a continuous increase in the population and its needs (Afifi, 2009).\",\n",
       "  'SOIL DEGRADATION': \"Every year, thousands of acres of arable land are taken from pastoral and agricultural activities due to erosion all over the country. The agricultural areas of Maradi and Zinder, cereal-growing areas by definition, are experiencing a drastic decrease in fertility due to a very weak return of organic substances, impoverishment of soil and high demographic pressure (UN and Government of Niger, 2005). Due to soil degradation, the productivity of the ''natural resources capital'' is decreasing and accessibility becomes more and more difficult. Even under the exploitation of greater areas, the increase of cereals production (2.5% per year) is largely below the growth of the population (3.1%) (Uppsala University, 2006). The strong human and animal pressures determine the intense exploitation of resources (American University, 1997). The increase of agricultural exploitation leads to the degradation of the forest-pastoral area, which in turn leads to the reduction and disappearance of important species (UN and Government of Niger, 2005). \",\n",
       "  'THE SHRINKING OF LAKE CHAD': \"Lake Chad lies within the northern African Sahel region and used to be shared by four countries: Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Situated on the edge of the Sahara Desert, it provides a vital source of water to human, livestock and wildlife communities. It was one of the most productive regions for freshwater fish in Africa. The annual fish catch in the early 1970s was up to 141,000 tons but dropped by 50 per cent since then. Droughts in the last three decades and patchy rain led to severe problems with water and food security in the Sahel region. Due to the frequent droughts, the lake's area decreased from approximately 25,000 km 2 in 1963 to about 1350 km 2 today (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, 2008). It no longer exists in Niger and is extremely shallow with maximum depths of just 7 m (even in the 1960s), highly depending on rainfall with seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations (Obada et al., 2006). According to Coe and Foley (2001), the lake decreased by 30 per cent between 1966 and 1975, but irrigation accounted only for 5 per cent of the loss. As water demand increased between 1983 and 1994, the anthropogenic contribution to the loss increased to 50 per cent (Coe and Foley, 2001).\\nWith the shrinking of the lake in the early 1960s, people living there started moving with the shoreline, crossing hereby national borders, especially that the lake has no boundary markers. In 1983, territorial disputes over emerging islands in the lake occurred. These disputes were settled by the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) and a joint patrol system in the region. Nevertheless, conflicts over resources have remained due to the lack of integrated water and environmental policies. The main disputes are over water, agricultural land around the lake (farmers invading pasture land) and fishing regulations. This has also provoked tensions between various ethnic groups; for example, in 1997, fights between Fulani herders and Djerma farmers were reported in Te´ra and Birni N'Gaoure´ (Obada et al., 2006).\",\n",
       "  'THE NIGER RIVER PROBLEMS': 'There are different environmental problems associated with the Niger River: The wastes of the factories flow into the river and lead to water pollution that in turn harms the fish reproduction and even survival, threatening hereby the livelihoods of fishermen. The water hyacinth has spread over large areas of the water surface and harms the fish production as well, since it deprives the bottom of the river of sunlight. Sand siltation is another reason why the fishermen suffer; the sand creeps into the river which -in turn -becomes shallower and, hence, the fish can no longer hide and reproduce. During the droughts in the early 1980s, the river almost dried out completely. This had a negative impact on the farmers and also the herders.',\n",
       "  'DEFORESTATION': 'Forests and protected areas are subject to threats, not only due to recurrent droughts but also -and especially -due to agricultural use and abusive exploitation with the use of fire. This phenomenon is particularly widespread in the Tahoua, Maradi and Zinder regions. Apparently 210 vegetal species contribute directly to human nourishment, especially during famine periods; 235 species are eaten by domestic animals; 270 are used in traditional cures; 127 species in handicraft work and shelter etc. (UN and Government of Niger, 2005). The lack of vegetation cover causes the soil and essential nutrients to be washed away by wind, sand and rain water (especially during the rainy season from July to October), contributing significantly to the process of soil degradation.',\n",
       "  'SAND INTRUSION': 'The sand threatens roads and other development infrastructures all over the country. In the northern-Sahelian part of the country, the sand invasion of lands and cereal cultivations compromises the growth of seeds and makes the production areas sterile (UN and Government of Niger, 2005). Moreover, the sand dunes have a very negative impact on land cultivation. The sand intrusion problem -similar to the siltation problem -is largely caused by deforestation and lack of vegetation cover, since usually trees can help block the massive movements of sand.\\nFrom the information above, it is obvious that climate change largely contributes to environmental degradation in Niger; climate change leads to droughts that in turn have a negative cumulative impact on the soil. This in turn has its negative implications for the livelihoods of farmers who consequently search for new sources of income by chopping down the trees for firewood or overgrazing the land, creating hereby the vicious circle of land exposure, sand intrusion and siltation and further environmental problems. On the other hand, the shrinking of Lake Chad is also a clear consequence of climate change; the patchy rainfall and frequent severe droughts caused by a warmer climate have negatively affected the water volume of the Lake.',\n",
       "  'OVERVIEW OF MIGRATION PROCESSES IN NIGER': \"Migration is a widespread phenomenon in Niger. Rural poverty and food insecurity have accelerated population migration from the rural areas to the cities in the southern part of the country (UNDP, 2006).\\nIn the mid-1970s, severe droughts forced thousands of young Touareg men to emigrate to neighbouring Libya and Algeria. In the 1980s, many returned with their governments promising them resettlement assistance, but the assistance never materialised. This and other grievances led to increased tensions between returning Touaregs and the government (Uppsala University, 2006).\\nTemporary migration of part or the whole household is a coping strategy during periods of drought and seasonal migration. Eighty per cent of working age males migrate seasonally from interior areas of South Sahara to coastal cities (Rural Migration News Agency, 2007). Remittances are a major source of income for many poor Nigerien farmers. They are used for taxes and marriage dowries and are invested in cattle and luxury goods (World Bank, 1996).\\nNiger and especially the region of Agadez, is the Central Sahara key route for migrants coming from Ghana, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, Mali and directed towards Libya and Tunisia with destination Canary Islands, Spain and Italy.\\nIn 2005, the stock of Nigerien emigrants was of 437,844 or 3.1 per cent of the total population. The top 10 destination countries are the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Chad, Benin, Togo, France, Italy, Germany, and United States (World Bank, 2006).\\nIn the same year, the stock of immigrants was of 123,687 or 0.9 per cent of the population. The percentage of female immigrants was 52 per cent and the percentage of immigrants as refugees was 0.3 per cent. The top 10 source countries were: Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Chad, and Sudan (World Bank, 2005). Inward remittance flows were US$ 14 million in the year 2000. In the year 2004, they reached US$ 60 million. Outward remittance flows were US$ 12 million in the year 2000, while in the year 2004, they amounted to US$ 25 million (World Bank, 2006).\",\n",
       "  'THE FIELD VISIT': 'The field visit that took place in February 2008 covered Niamey and Tillabe´ri. However, interviews were run with migrants from all other regions who left for these two regions. The field work was based on making interviews with 25 experts from local authorities, university, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations (see section 12). As for the questionnaires, in total, 60 migrant (25 of which were returned migrants from Libya) and 20 non-migrant questionnaires were filled out. The second category is made up of people who suffer from environmental problems but resisted and stayed in their towns ⁄ regions.\\nThe questionnaires mainly targeted migrants who left their home for the two regions of research (Niamey and Tillabe´ri) within Niger, in an attempt to find out whether environmental problems influenced their migration decision. These questionnaires also included questions about relatives and friends of the interviewees who had left the region ⁄ country due to environmental problems.\\nPart of the questionnaires were filled out in the International Organization for Migration (IOM) office with some permanent migrants to Nigeria and Chad who were paying short visits to Niamey at the time the field work was carried out. Moreover, the IOM office facilitated meetings with returned migrants from Libya, in the frame of a re-integration programme that the office organises, helping this category of Nigeriens to start new lives in Niger, after having been deported from Libya or after returning back voluntarily, as is discussed in detail in the following sections. The research relied additionally on questionnaires that were filled out with the support of the head of the Filingue department in Til-labe´ri who facilitated the contacts with migrants. In addition to the filled out questionnaires, there were also phone calls with people who live close to Lake Chad in the East of the country (Diffa).\\nOther than people interviewed in the IOM office, the interviewees themselves were chosen based on the environmental hotspots in Niger that are listed in section 5. Therefore, the areas visited were mainly villages where farmers and cattle herders lived and might have suffered from droughts and soil degradation, slums of Niamey, as well as the shore of the Niger River. In many cases, one interviewee led to the other.\\nBefore demonstrating the results of the expert interviews and migrant and non-migrant questionnaires in detail, it is useful to give an overview of the migration patterns that are said to be influenced by environmental degradation in the most important villages of the Tillabe´ri region, a main research area of this paper. The information is based on the Niger Ministry of Environment (2006).',\n",

       "  'Outcomes of expert interviews': 'This section starts with a brief historical background that shows how different factors, including environmental degradation, contributed to the migration patterns in Niger, and answering the questions: Who are the people who migrate ⁄ d? From where to where do ⁄ did they migrate? What are the coping mechanisms for environmental problems in Niger?',\n",
       "  'A historical overview of environmental migration in Niger': \"When the colonial era started in the year 1990, the new forces were in need of supplies for their soldiers and missions towards Chad. Therefore, the trees were cut, chopped and used in the construction of new buildings. The environmental problems started in the Ouallem area that became the most degraded; it had been covered by palm trees (Dom palms) which were all cut down to serve for the construction of the buildings. Moreover, the workers were expected to construct the infrastructure of the new forces. This took labour away from the field, and thus, agriculture was neglected. Furthermore, since no one was available to bring the crops to the storage, they became spoiled. People who used to work in the granaries were no longer available there, working instead for the colonies.\\nIn the year 1906, the complete monetisation of the economy took place; the people were expected to pay the taxes in coins, the supply of which was controlled by the new forces. As a result, people had to sell their crops in order to assemble enough coins for paying taxes. Before the monetisation in Niger, it was common to rely on the use values (barter deals) rather than exchange values (using coins). Since the supply of coins was very low, people started competing over obtaining them, and thus, no food reserves were left to cover the drought periods. This led to the great famine of the year 1913, and accordingly, the beginning of the famine cycle in Niger. As a consequence, and up to present, each time a drought hits the country, people get further and accumulatively behind.\\nIn order for the people to increase their crop production, they overplanted the lands with cash crops, such as peanuts, especially in the East of the country. The fields of these crops were called tax fields or Gona Limpo (originally L'impoˆt). When the land got overused, large migration episodes to neighbouring countries started. However, there are no records on how many left, how many stayed, and how many died on their way to other countries or on their way back to Niger. Many left for the Gold Coast, today's Ghana, where mining was their main employment. It was a dangerous but therefore highly paid job. Those who did not want to risk their lives in such activities went to the coast close to the ports and worked as ''dockers'' who offloaded cargo ships, also in Ghana.\\nAfter the independence in Niger and Ghana in the years 1960 and 1957, respectively, political problems developed, which led to economic problems in Ghana, and people from the western parts of Niger switched to the Ivory Coast for cocoa production, since it was an economy that would provide them with the necessary income. People from the eastern parts then went to Nigeria for petroleum production.\\nSince the mid-1990s, Nigeriens no longer go to the Ivory Coast due to the civil war which also targeted migrant labour. Migration to Nigeria stopped as well due to problems in the petroleum economy. Furthermore, there were political and religious problems between the North and the South of Nigeria.\\nNowadays, most of the migrants -whether environmental or traditionalgo to Libya, particularly, since the mid 1990s. The Libyan president contributed to making it a habit for Nigeriens to leave for his country; when the international embargo against Libya took place in the 1990s, the president invited African labour to build the economy of Libya to construct infrastructure and contribute to the economic activities. When the embargo was lifted, the African labour was no longer as welcome as before.\\nWho are the people who migrate ⁄ d?\\nUsually, people who migrate within and outside Niger are young men; women, elderly and children are left behind. It is also common that young men leave and return back after a while and support their families financially. Nevertheless, the trend rather moves towards ''one way'' migration. The lack of records does not allow determining the number of people who left and who did not return. Moreover, it is hard to link -or not link -all the migrants to the environment due to the overlap between the factors (Rural Migration News Agency, 2007). This point of view was shared by most of the experts interviewed in Niger.\\nFrom where to where do ⁄ did the Nigeriens migrate?\",\n",
       "  'Local migration': \"Before the severe drought cycle, cattle herders (mostly Fulani ethinic group) used to move from the North (dry lands) to the South (fertile lands) to follow the rainfalls (mainly in the Tillabe´ri region) and further feed their animals, but today, most of the South is occupied by farmers (mostly Djerma ethnic group) who use the land for agriculture. The people who have farmed there would not easily leave their lands for others, since they cannot afford that. In the Tahoua region (partly in the South), farmers are even moving to the North, since they need more land due to soil degradation, rapid population growth, and consequent declining absolute and average yields. They move to pastoral areas and begin to cultivate marginal lands with lower productivity, especially in places where the herders are absent, wandering with their animals somewhere else to search for food. When the herders return back, the conflicts between them and the farmers who ''intruded'' on their lands start; the farmers claim that the land was empty and use their plants as a proof of ownership. Hence, current migration due to environmental problems in Niger is a general phenomenon with no specific directions, since deforestation and droughts are spread all over the country, and the ownership relations are not defined or documented. In addition to the conflicts caused by migration to marginal lands, the pressure on the limited natural resources increases, and hence, the soil quality keeps deteriorating. The problem would enhance over time, given the rapid population growth, likely leading to larger migration flows, and thus, increasing the pressure on these natural resources. A logical consequence is the creation of further economic and social problems in the areas of destination, especially that the immigrants are usually perceived and treated as ''foreigners'' by the original inhabitants of these areas. \",\n",
       "  'International migration': \"In the case of Libya, most of the migrants plan to go back to Niger after having achieved their main goal there, which is improving their earning level. The shortest time spent in Libya for interviewees of this paper was six months and the longest eight years. Nigeriens rarely travel to Europe through Libya, since the latter is their destination. This is because they are still attached to their families and profound links; geographically, Libya is closer and lies on the same continent. They would always return, as long as they can. An important evidence for their emotional attachment is that they rarely leave for the Maghreb countries (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia), although the latter are francophone -as Niger is -in comparison with Libya, and logistically it is easier to move from Morocco -though Gibraltar -to Europe. Nevertheless, they prefer to ''keep an eye'' on their country.\\nIn this respect, it is important to make a distinction between the ethnic groups with their various mind sets. For example, the Tuaregs who live in the arid North (Agadez region), many of which work in activities of mineral extraction, are better off compared to the people in the semi-arid South who mainly rely on farming -which means that their livelihoods mainly depend on the environmental services. People in the North usually travel to Europe as a matter of prestige. An interviewee mentions: ''An average Tuareg bride would prefer to get married to a man who used to live in -or at least visited -Europe, since this is an indicator for wealth and better education''. However, when people in the fertile South migrate, they do it as a matter of survival, as a consequence of the deteriorating conditions of the land they plant on. Therefore, rather than travelling to Europe, they travel to other African countries -if they leave Niger in first place -where there are similar agricultural activities to theirs and the culture and language are similar as well. These countries are mainly Benin, Cameron, Chad, Ghana, Ivory Cost, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo. The same applies to fishermen who are suffering from the Niger River problems. Noteworthy is the fact that people in Niger working in mineral extraction -and who would rather move to Europe -are a minority, and therefore, they do not really represent the overall migration patterns in the country. As mentioned above, most of the population relies on farming, cattle herding and fishing activities.\",\n",
       "  'What are the coping mechanisms for environmental problems?': \"There are people who resist the environmental problems in Niger, but these are mostly located in the extreme South of Tillabe´ri particularly in the South of Niamey, where nature is richer and the areas are environmentally protected. Also in Gaya (Dosso region), on the border with Benin, there are stronger and more frequent rainfalls, where there is a protected national park called Park W. In these areas, fertility of land is easier to maintain, and there are more trees and higher rainfall.\\nIn the regions that are deserted by young males due to the environmental problems, especially in the dry seasons, only women, elderly and children stay, a fact that has a negative impact on environmental restoration or any other kind of environmental work. Women undertake this work indeed, such as re-planting trees, fixing sand dunes, digging half moon depressions (demi lunes) that help save the rain water in the soil, and placing heavy stones that prevent siltation, but they miss the physical support of the young men who leave. In some cases, teams of women are doing all the work to restore environment, which is not sufficient, especially since they have other priorities, such as taking care of the children and the elderly. Furthermore, if the husbands do not send sufficient money, the women have to work to get food instead. And in the villages and rural areas, there are only very few opportunities to work, especially for women.\\nThe following are actions taken by the women in order to survive the deteriorating environment:\\n1. They organise saving circles ⁄ cooperatives, which helps them purchase goods and resell them in the market. 2. Women might also work as hired labourers in other people's fields, which is very unusual and a real sign of extreme desperation. When doing that, in most cases, they do not obtain cash money but grain. 3. In the worst cases where no grain is available, women rely on their encyclopaedic knowledge about edible wild plants to survive and feed their children.\\nThe state started 2006 a -so-called -President's Programme that helps the people stay and restore the environment instead of leaving it behind. It even offers financial means for these people as an incentive to them not to leave and for those who left to return back. In the process of implementing the Programme, it has been decided that 60,000 young men in total who would show willingness to restore the environment would be recruited throughout the eight regions of the country for some amounts of money. According to one of the programme coordinators in the Ministry of Environment, this operation ''shall help bring back many young men back to their regions to take part in the restoration of the environment.'' Thanks to the programme, 35,000 temporary jobs were created in 2006. They include fixing sand dunes, controlling tree chopping, digging half moons, and digging out sand from the river. To the date of the field visit, some 6,950 acres of degraded land were restored, some 1,200 acres of dunes were fixed, and 2,400 km of firebreaks have been cleared.\",\n",
       "  'Outcomes of questionnaires': \"Most of the interviewees referred to economic factors, such as poverty and unemployment, as reasons for moving from one village ⁄ region to the other, or even moving abroad. However, when tracing the root causes for migration, results indicated that almost all of them have been influenced by environmental problems in their decision to migrate. For example, the questionnaire started with general questions on the reasons why the interviewees and their families migrated, but gradually moved to the nature of their work ⁄ activity, most of which were farming and cattle herding. When asking the farmers and cattle herders why they became unemployed or poorer, the main reasons were the declining crop yield or death of animals due to the droughts and water shortage. Moreover, when asking the fishermen the same question, most of them mentioned that the main reason was their deteriorating livelihood due to droughts and ⁄ or lack of fish production caused by various problems occurring in the Niger River. The examples were more obvious and more striking in the case of Lake Chad, since in this case people directly linked their migration decision to the shrinking of the Lake.\\nThe fishermen mainly complain about the siltation problems. A fisherman in the village Sirba, Te´ra (Tillabe´ri) said: ''I have been suffering from the rain water shortage which made the river very shallow and decreased my fish production. This had negative implications for my income. I might leave for another country, if the situation does not improve, like some of my friends and relatives did; they left for Benin, Nigeria and Burkina Faso and settled there''.\\nThere were other fishermen who live in the village Goudel (Niamey) and who complained about the same problems. For example, a fisherman there said: ''Some of my friends have completely left the country, and some others leave seasonally for Mali and Benin, where they can obtain better fish production''. The same applies to some fishermen interviewed in the villages Gamkale Sorkaydo and Kombo in Niamey.\\nThe majority of the migrants who left for Libya and returned back were suffering from droughts and their negative impact on their crops, cattle, and hence, income generation. They left there from different villages and regions in Niamey. The reasons why they returned back differ from one case to the other. For most of them, life in Libya did not meet their expectations. Some were deported and the rest saved the money they need and were willing to start new projects in Niger. A returned migrant from the village Talcho, Filingue (Tillabe´ri) mentioned in this interview: ''I lost hope in producing crops, since the soil got too poor due to the droughts. I used to be a farmer in my home town. Therefore, I first went to Lome´(Congo) and then Libya. Now I have decided to return back to Niger where I will start a new business with the money I managed to save in Libya.'' Another interviewed returned migrant from the village Badeguichiri in the region Tahoua told his story as follows: ''My family and I were farmers. Then the famine of 2005 took place. I used to have five cars for transportation, and I made my living from this. Due to the famine, I had to sell one car after the other till only one was left. I gave it to my son to work on it and left for Libya to earn money.''\\nThe inhabitants of the Care´village in the Filingue Department within the Tillabe´ri region are all migrants of the Farka village in the Ouallem Department of the same region. After the soil has degraded and sand dunes completely hit Farka, farming became impossible and the people left the village for Care´. An interviewee said in this context:\\nWe were farmers in Farka, but the production level worsened tremendously and the harvest became completely unreliable due to the rain fall shortage and soil degradation. We hence had no alternative revenues. The sand dunes made our life impossible there. Therefore, we had to flee this village in the year 1987. There is no other reason why we left the original village; if this deterioration in the soil quality had not happened, we would have stayed. Currently, in Care´we are suffering from similar problems and might therefore leave the village for another as well. We have never planned to leave, but we just 'crept' after our livelihood. It is not only us; there are complete villages that have disappeared due to the sand dunes and whose inhabitants had to move to other villages.\\nIn an interview with a lady who used to live in the Lake Chad Region (Diffa) and is currently in Niamey acquiring sewing skills, she mentioned: ''The lake completely dried out in the year 1989 and so many people left for Nigeria and Chad. My activities were not really related to the lake, and therefore, I stayed in the region. I heard from others that the lake appeared again in the year 2005, but I am not sure of this information. The lake was very shallow anyway''. Another interviewee who was coincidently visiting Niger during the period of the field research said: ''I used to live in the Lake Chad region where my activities were not directly related to the lake. I used to be a merchant. However, when the lake dried out, people depending on it left for other countries, and therefore, my business was negatively affected and I had to leave for Nigeria''. Lake Chad did not only shrink because of droughts but also due to overexploitation; people used to plant their crops ''inside'' the shallow parts of the lake. What remained were only the deepest parts of the lake in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria, but no longer in Niger. As a result, some of the Toubou ethnic group left the Diffa region, where the lake used to be. The Canouri ethnic group also left the region, since with the shrinking of the lake, they lost their income resources. The same applies to the Bhodouma ethnic group who rely in their livelihood on a cow species called ''Vache Kouri'' that almost died out with the shrinking of the lake. This ethnic group is losing its identity and becoming scattered in other regions and countries, such as Nigeria.\\nOverall, answering the question whether at any point of time environmental problems affected one's decision to move, 90 per cent of the interviewed migrants had a positive answer. Around 70 per cent of the migrants expect environmental problems in the future to make them and their families migrate to different places, more than 50 per cent of which are planning indeed to leave due to environmental problems. Eighty per cent of the interviewees mentioned that they would return back to their villages ⁄ regions, if the environmental conditions there would improve. Interviewees who are not willing to leave as well as people who did not leave in first place are either attached to their regions or have adapted to the environmental problems they are facing.\",\n",
       "  'CONCLUSIONS, POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH': \"From the analysis above, it is obvious that environmental degradation does have a considerable impact on migration patterns in Niger. Although seasonal migration is part of the Nigerien culture, permanent migration -mainly within the country but also to other African countries in the South -is becoming a norm. This indicates that environment is a core reason why people leave, especially since most of the population relies on environmental services on a daily basis, due to the nature of their activities as farmers, cattle herders and fishermen. Niger has always been one of the poorest countries of the world, reflected in its low per capita income and economic growth. Seasonal migration has always existed as well, due to the nature of its climate. Nevertheless, migration becoming a long-term even permanent phenomenon highlights the importance of the more and more deteriorating environment and its impact on changing the migration patterns in the country, especially when tracing the root causes of the decision to migrate by considering the questionnaires.\\nObviously, the trends of migration within Niger changed over time; after people were used to moving from the North to the South, searching for fertile lands, rapid population growth made people from the South search for marginal lands in the North. Currently, the movements have no particular direction; people 'creep' after their livelihoods, in order to survive the environmental damage.\\nIn Niger, there are hardly any sudden natural disasters, such as earthquakes or volcanoes which force people to leave immediately and on the spot. Nevertheless, the slow-onset environmental phenomena in Niger make the living conditions of the Nigeriens difficult, and due to economic problems -mainly caused by these environmental phenomenathey migrate. Therefore, the paper suggests the term 'Environmentally induced economic migration' for application on the case of Niger, since on the surface, people leave their villages ⁄ regions due to purely economic problems, but these are in turn highly linked to the environmental degradation in the country, regardless of the historical tradition of seasonal migration.\\nMigrating to Europe is not a typical ''Nigerien dream''. Nigerien people prefer to stay on their land. If the environmental conditions worsen, they move to the next possible place to live. Therefore, the pull factors in the capital, Niamey, rather play a smaller role as compared to the push factors in the home villages ⁄ regions, especially that farmers and cattle herders are attached to the land and to their activities on one hand, and the alternative activities that the capital offers to them are simple irregular jobs and sometimes even begging activities, on the other. Hence, moving to the capital in this case is rather a matter of survival.\\nIn general, the ''creeping'' environmental migration process is very gradual and rarely ends up in Europe but rather in other African neighbouring countries where the migrants find new means of survival. Since it is the farmers and cattle herders who mostly suffer from the environmental problems and -at the same time -it is them who are mostly vulnerable to poverty due to the nature of their work, they usually cannot afford leaving for Europe. In addition, many other cultural aspects might hinder them from leaving the African continent. For example, people in the rural areas of the South use certain dialects ⁄ languages, such as Hausa and Folani that might as well be spoken in other African neighbouring countries. Unfortunately, there are no official figures or estimates about the number of people migrating within and out of Niger.\\nThere is no doubt that environmentally induced economic migration in Niger is a matter of a vicious circle, especially that the environmental problems are interrelated; droughts lead to poverty; which makes people cut the trees to sell the wood and survive. As a result, sand creeps, intrudes and silts, harming the farmers, herders and fishermen, who in turn have to migrate and leave their families and the damaged environment behind. At the same time, the lack of vegetation cover -due to deforestation -causes the soil to lose useful nutrients, which also negatively affects the livelihoods of the farmers and makes them leave. Finally, the environmental conditions worsen, as the people left behind are not capable of restoring it sufficiently (Figure 1).\\nThe main policy recommendations in the case of Niger are the following:\\n-Development policies that prevent further environmental degradation, such as protecting natural resources (e.g., tree wood, water) and controlling the non-sustainable overexploitation of the land, should be implemented. -Local and foreign investments that create new jobs in the country and that are environment friendly should be encouraged. -Education campaigns should be provided to farmers, cattle herders, fishermen and people working in the industry sector, in order to offer them knowledge about considering the environment when There should also be effective follow up on the people who returned back to restore the environment, in order to guarantee the usefulness and sustainability of the Programme in the long run. -The re-integration programme that was initiated by IOM Niamey should not only be applied on returned migrants from Libya but from other countries and also in the case of local migration.\\nIn the future research, it would be advisable to run longer field trips with more observations. Furthermore, it would be interesting to visit the countries where Lake Chad has not completely dried out (Chad and Cameron) and run interviews with the Nigeriens who left their country following their livelihoods and ask them about their experience with the lake, how they coped with the situation, and the circumstances that made them leave Niger and move to the other countries.\\nIn addition, it would be recommendable to involve the time factor in the research by tracing the Nigeriens who left their regions ⁄ country due to environmental problems, following up with them and running a comparison between their situations before and after their migration process. Last but not least, the poor statistics and lack of concrete numbers and figures is an obstacle for solid research. Therefore, assisting the local partners in Niger -and the developing countries in general -in gathering information about environment and migration and creating reliable data bases corresponding to the two issues are enormously necessary for future research in the area of environmental migration.\"},\n",

       "  'Table of contents': \"According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007, 9.2.1, 9.4.4, 9.6.1), the East and Horn of Africa is projected to be one of the regions of the world most negatively affected by climate change. Environmental change in countries in the East and Horn of Africa already includes prolonged droughts, desertification, flash floods and land degradation, all of which will likely be exacerbated by climate change in the medium and long term. The interplay between climate change, conflicts, violence and refugee movement is considered to be particularly striking in this region.\\nNotwithstanding the current crisis, the region has long been a major hub for UNHCR's work, as around five million people, or 14 per cent of the total number of people of concern to UNHCR (asylum seekers, refugees, IDPs, returnees, stateless persons) worldwide, live here (UNHCR, 2010) 1 . UNHCR has also observed that environmental considerations are increasingly affecting the movement of refugees and IDPs in the East and Horn of Africa. In light of these considerations, this study, 1 Please note that these figures do not include the substantial influx of new refugees from Somalia into countries such as Ethiopia and Uganda due to the ongoing impacts of conflict, drought and food shortage crises in Somalia. It is hoped that the findings from this study will contribute to the growing body of empirical evidence on the links between climate change and human mobility (Henry et al. 2004;Perch et al. 2008;Jäger et al. 2009;Afifi and Jäger 2011;Warner et al. 2009 a and b; Foresight 2011), and will assist UNHCR, as the agency mandated to provide international protection to and assist those who flee their homes because of the threat of persecution and violence, to consider its future policy and response to people who may be compelled to move in the face of increasing environmental stress and unsustainability.\\n_ 12\",\n",
       "  'I. Key findings': 'This study examines the perceptions and experiences of refugees in the East and Horn of Africa (specifically refugees in camps and settlements in Ethiopia and Uganda respectively, who originated primarily from Eritrea, Somalia and some from Eastern Sudan) in order to better understand if, how and to what extent the impacts of climate and environmental change in their countries of origin played a role in their movement away from their homelands. The study made the following key findings: For those who relied on agricultural and pastoral activities for a living, this had a direct and negative impact on their livelihoods and food security. Those not directly involved in agricultural and pastoral activities were also indirectly affected by declining turnover and profit amongst traders and by rising food prices as a consequence of diminished agricultural output. • field visits to UNHCR refugee camps to conduct individual, group and expert interviews;\\n• where appropriate, filming and audiotaping the interviews with groups and individuals;\\n• debriefing sessions to discuss the main observations and findings with the informants, including persons of concern to UNHCR; and\\n• analysis and validation of findings with academic experts.

       "  'Selection of participants and research methods': 'Experts and stakeholders in the field of climate change and human mobility in the Horn of Africa (e.g., Government representatives, refugee and environmental NGOs and local UNHCR staff) in Addis Ababa and Kampala were approached before refugee camps were visited in the respective countries. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on an individual basis with these key informants to gather information and obtain an overview of the issues, as well as to understand their views and experiences.\\nIn the refugee camps, focus group interviews with up to 10 people at a time were conducted with refugees from Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, as well as with two groups of Ethiopian and Ugandan IDPs. The interviewees comprised those who originated from rural areas and whose livelihoods were primarily natural resource-based (e.g., farmers, pastoralists). It was a working hypothesis that the impact of climate-related impacts would be strongest and most direct among this population. Former urban residents were nevertheless also included in order to obtain a broader understanding of movements from the respective countries.\\nBesides livelihood activities and place of origin, the selection of the target population aimed at a balanced representation in terms of ethnicity, gender and age. At each refugee or IDP camp or settlement, interview groups were comprised of a family unit, a group of male heads of household, a group of women and a group of elderly (> 50 years of age) men and women. Focus group discussions were the primary tool for gathering data, which was determined to be the best method to gather a range of views in a short period of time. The setting of a focus group discussion is also more natural than a one-to-one interview and explicitly makes use of group interaction to generate information and insights. The statements made by the participants are in a group context and subject to a dynamic discussion process -they may be commented on, discussed and contested by other participants.\\nIt proved useful to generate narratives and thus gain insights into the perceptions and experiences of informants about issues related to climate conditions, conflict, violence and mobility.\\nThe content of the discussions was structured chronologically, beginning with the time before the participants left their place of origin, and ending with the time they fled their countries and sought refuge in the camps. Information was sought concerning their livelihood activities, their perception of changing climatic conditions, how they were affected and how they coped with and adapted to climatic stress and trends, as well as the reasons for their flight from their homes. Each discussion was facilitated by an interviewer. Audio records and notes were taken, and the discussions were filmed where consent was given.',\n",
       "  'Limitations': 'Many refugees, especially those from Sudan and those staying in Uganda, had lived in refugee camps for periods between 10 and 20 years, making the recall period for the subject of interest very long. It was thus difficult to assess whether in their narratives they were describing \"normal\" climate variations or trends that could indicate climate change. This was exacerbated by the fact that climate in the region is characterized by a high degree of variability.\\nGathering narratives was important as it gave insights into the way people perceived, experienced and evaluated certain events and processes. As Meze-Hausken (2004) has shown through systematic comparisons between perceptions of climate change and meteorological data, there can be a mismatch between these data sources (i.e. perception and scientific data) for different reasons: on the one hand, individuals\\' perceptions of changing rainfall could be linked to the changing need for rainfall or other environmental factors that lead to reduced water availability; on the other hand, the paucity of available scientific data might lead to a mismatch with the perceptions of individuals.',\n",
       "  '_ 20': 'Another limitation of the study is that the target population was generally comprised of refugees (with the exception of two groups of IDPs). Therefore, participants in the interviews repeatedly emphasized political reasons for their movement, making it difficult to assess the role of climate-related events as an element contributing to their movement. This was further exacerbated by two factors. Firstly, despite assurances to the contrary, the researchers were sometimes perceived to be part of UNHCR, the agency assisting the refugees. Those participating in the interviews were on the one hand cautious about their statements, while on the other hand raising their immediate problems in the hope that the researchers could provide solutions. Secondly, the field visits to each camp or settlement were very brief, lasting a few days only. The development of relationships of trust with the refugees, that would have allowed a more in-depth understanding, was limited. The use of interpreters to facilitate the focus group discussions (some were professional interpreters but others were refugees who spoke English) at times distorted the content of the narratives and also made the development of trust challenging.\\nA final limitation relates to the regional focus of the study.\\nThe primary focus of the study was to gather information from refugees originating from the East and Horn of Africa. This objective was only partly accomplished, as refugees from Ethiopia -one of the key countries in the region -were not interviewed.\\nThe reason for this gap is that it was not possible to visit refugee camps hosting Ethiopian refugees in Eritrea or Kenya owing to the security situation in those countries at the time.\\n_ 22',\n",
       "  'III. Perceptions of climate variability and impacts of climatic stress': 'What does the literature say?\\nRecent academic studies have recognized the importance of studies on perception of climate change (Deressa et al., 2011;Tröger et al., 2011) According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007, 9.2.1, 9.4.4, 9.6.1), agricultural production and food security (including access to food) in many African countries and regions are likely to be severely compromised by the effects of climate change and climate variability. Subsistence and smallholder farmers, including pastoralists and agro-pastoralists, are likely to be most severely affected (Morton, 2007, p. 19680). The effects of climate change, as Morton (2007, p. 19683; see also Tröger et al., 2011) highlights, will increase the likelihood of crop failure, increase diseases and mortality among livestock, impact livelihoods by forcing households to sell their assets, cut health and educational expenditure and migration, and increase the likelihood of indebtedness and dependency on external help. Furthermore, there could be possible feedback through unsustainable adaptation strategies which lead to environmental degradation.\\nWith regard to agricultural production, the IPCC has projected reductions in yield in some African countries to be as much as 50 per cent by 2020, and crop net revenues could fall by as much as 90 per cent by 2100 (IPCC, 2007). Additionally, climate change-induced resource scarcity is projected to increase the risk of violent conflicts between competing groups (Homer-Dixon, 1994, 1999;IPCC 2001;WBGU, 2007). Discussions are ongoing about whether climate change should be considered as a cause of conflicts or better understood as a threat multiplier (see for instance Barnett and Adger, 2007;Evans, 2010). Nevertheless, potential interaction between the two processes is recognized by the United Nations as a significant future challenge, as expressed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (2007, cited in Evans, 2010, p. 5): \"... changes in our environment and the resulting upheavals -from droughts to inundated coastal areas to loss of arable lands -are likely to become a major driver of war and conflict\". As underlined by the IPCC in 2007, conflicts which have recently occurred in the Greater Horn of Africa, namely in Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan, caused by structural inequalities, resource mismanagement and unstable governments, were often exacerbated by environmental degradation. Climate stressors may therefore intensify or become a contributing factor to conflicts (Abdalla, 2006;IPCC, 2007). \"Drought has affected cropping systems. Some areas used to grow millet but have changed to sorghum as sorghum is more drought tolerant. This affects health and nutrition. \" \"First, the rain did not come on time. I noticed it becoming more windy and sunny. There was not enough rain in the key months -June and July. Now the rain would only come for three or four days at a time. No longer did we have the prolonged rainfall we needed for a successful harvest. \"',\n",
       "  'Study findings': '',\n",
       "  \"Experts' views\": 'Prolonged drought and severe flooding experienced in recent years were identified by experts interviewed as key factors leading to an increase in rural-urban migration within the countries in which they were situated (i.e. Ethiopia and Uganda). Ministry of Agriculture, Uganda \"In the south-west of Uganda, people from this region have always moved in response to environmental change as they are pastoralists. However, movement of people from the south-west is becoming more permanent. The cattle corridor… has seen some Ugandan pastoralists moving more permanently south across the border into Northern Tanzania. \"\\nMinistry of Agriculture, Uganda \"Ethiopian pastoralists have for a long time crossed the border into Kenya when water was scarce and then moved back again. Because of prolonged drought, this has changed this coping mechanism of this society. Now they not only move across borders but to other regions in Ethiopia. This creates conflicts with other groups. \"\\nInternational Organization for Migration, Ethiopia _ 42',\n",
       "  'Perceptions of climate change in the': 'Elderly farmer from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia \"It went from sustained rain to rain not starting on time to raining for only two to four days and not longer than that. \"\\nElderly farmer from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia Interviews held with elderly farmers and pastoralists (> 50 years of age), especially those from Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea, were particularly revealing as many noted that they were well aware that their regions were drought-prone but that the droughts experienced in recent years were, to them, more severe and prolonged than those they had personally experienced in all the years they had been working on the land.\\n\"It [drought] happens since the world was created, but not like this since five years ago. \"\\nFarmer from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia \"Once we experienced a lack of rain like never before. This was in 2006-2007. \" Farmer from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia \"The weather has become odder and odder. There used to be floods but today there are no floods. People suffer from famine during the droughts. If there is an absence of rain, nobody can do anythingit is a decision of God. \"\\nElderly farmer from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia Refugees from Sudan, who had been present in Ethiopia and Uganda for long periods, some for over 20 years, made a particular point of indicating that they had noticed negative trends in climatic conditions in their respective host countries. In Uganda in particular, as beneficiaries of a government policy which sees most refugees being allocated small plots of land on which to establish small-scale vegetable gardens (to supplement food rations), interviewees complained of a recent trend of failed harvests because of prolonged arid conditions and the more frequent onset of crop-destroying pests.\\nVery few refugees interviewed demonstrated that they were aware of climate change as a global phenomenon. Some did indicate their awareness of changing weather and environmental patterns that they had experienced as being related to climatic changes affecting a region larger than their own or even just their country. None offered a scientific explanation for the changes they had perceived, however very few had experienced any form of formal education. Others, however, invoked religious or spiritual reasons for worsening climatic conditions, such as God\\'s will or displeasure at situations of poor political governance or perceived personal failings.\\nFrom the focus group discussions with refugees, four areas can be identified that are affected by climate change and climate variability: a) farming and livestock husbandry, b) food and livelihood security, c) social cohesion, and d) conflict.',\n",
       "  'Farming and livestock husbandry': 'Climate-related events, such as droughts, and trends such as declining precipitation were perceived by the refugees interviewed to have had severe effects on farming and livestock husbandry in their countries of origin. Refugees, especially those from Eritrea and Somalia, reported the loss of their harvest and death of cattle due to severe droughts. In their narratives, the drought event of 1984-1985 in the Horn of Africa was still very present and a landmark in their memory of the impact of climatic events. Droughts were nevertheless described as recurrent events that regularly prevent people from carrying out farming activities and lead to regular losses in respect of agricultural production.\\nBesides the impact of these shock events, the refugees interviewed also decried continued decline in agricultural yields due to decreasing amounts of rain and changing seasonal patterns. For example, one Tigrinya farmer from Eritrea reported that in good years he harvested up to 40 to 50 quintal (100 kg) of grain. Before they fled from Eritrea their yield had decreased to only three to four quintal, and sometimes they did not have any yield at all.\\nDecreasing rainfall was also reported as affecting the availability and quality of grassland, which has an effect on the health and value of livestock.\\nIn addition to the impact on agricultural output, changing climate was also perceived by the refugees as having had an effect on their livelihood systems. On the one hand, refugees reported shifts in agriculture-related livelihood activities: changes of crop plants to species more adapted to short wet periods and a change of activities from farming to cattle herding. Others reported shifts to non-agricultural activities.\\n\"It was during the time when Reagan was President of the USA, in 1984. There were no grazing possibilities for the cattle at all. I can remember that there was no rain and a lot of cattle died. \"\\nAgro-pastoralist from Darfur, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia \"Rainfall has been decreasing since the year before liberation -I noticed a very big difference in the height of grass. In the early days it was like savannah grass, now it is short and thin. \" Tigrinya pastoralist from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia',\n",
       "  'Food and livelihood security': 'As most of the refugees interviewed were partly or wholly subsistence farmers, declining yields and diminishing livestock had a direct impact on their livelihoods and food security. Refugees reported that during years with unfavourable climatic conditions, they had to ration food, eat less and often suffered from hunger.\\nDuring extreme events mortality, especially among young children, is reported to have risen. People said that they had to dispose of assets and borrow money in order to buy food and seeds for the next planting season. The possession of livestock was considered an important asset, not only as a source of milk and meat but also as a product that could be sold in order to get money to buy food. Refugees who were not directly engaged in agricultural activities, and therefore not directly affected by climatic events, remarked that they were indirectly affected because losses and declining income among farmers and pastoralists decreased their purchasing power, which led to declining turnover and profit among traders. Furthermore, refugees originating from urban areas reported rising food prices, which they attributed among other reasons to the poor agro-climatic conditions.\\n\"During such a year we managed to feed our families with only very little, we had to borrow money from others to buy seed. Some families sold their cattle, sheep and goats in order to get food. Those who didn\\'t have cattle faced a bad situation without anything. \" Tigrinya agro-pastoralist from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia \"The environment has changed in central Somalia. It is getting dryer. We were not directly affected […] but these changes did have an impact on pastoralists and farmers around the town. Indirectly, our business was affected because the drought affected the buying power of people. \"\\nShopkeeper from central Somalia, Shedr Camp, Ethiopia',\n",
       "  'Social cohesion': 'Less direct and more subtle is the impact of climate change and climate variability on the social fabric and moral economy of a community. It can be assumed that sustained stress and increasing resource scarcity in a community will lead to a transformation of the ways people within the community interact and organize themselves. During the focus group discussions, although these issues were rarely raised, those who did mention social organization, reported that climatic stress had a negative impact on the way different segments of society supported each other.\\n\"Before, Eritreans used to help each other. All Eritreans helped each other and there was a \\'good attitude\\' . But now the attitudes of Eritreans have changed -because of the drought. People do not help each other anymore and that makes it harder to survive. \"\\nSaho farmer from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia',\n",
       "  'Conflict': 'From the empirical evidence gathered during the field visits, it is also difficult to make any clear statement with regard to the relationship between climate stressors and conflicts. The refugees interviewed did not report any conflicts -at least not violent forms of conflict -occurring as a result of environmental stress within their community. Anecdotal reports were made of conflicts between ethnic groups and between farmers and pastoralists.\\nHowever, it is difficult to single out environmental causes, as these events are mostly related to broader conflict constellations.\\n_ 30 \"We were victims of cattle raids by the Murle tribe who came during the dry season. They would come and burn the houses and the stored food as well. Our village was attacked four times. We were living with those tribes together side by side.\\nThen in 1962 the attacks by the Murle started. Later they associated themselves with the northern Sudanese government. They would come to attack the village and kill people.\\nAfter each attack by the Murle, the people would move to another village, and then they were attacked again. We decided to move further and then we moved to Pochalla town. After we were attacked there as well, we decided to leave the country. \"\\nAnyuak Pochalla man from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia\\nThe minority Bantu farmers from Somalia, for example, who were particularly affected by violence after the breakdown of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, reported that Somali pastoralists were grazing on their farms, looting their grain stores and destroying their villages. An Eritrean Saho farmer who was internally displaced from the border region to the western part of Eritrea as a result of the Eritrean-Ethiopian war, described their conflictladen relationship with the local farmers in the places to which they were relocated. Local farmers regularly drove their cattle onto the farms of IDPs, and sporadically physical violence occurred between local people and IDPs. From the anecdotal evidence gathered, climate change-induced resource scarcity could be considered as a multiplier of conflicts.',\n",
       "  'IV. In situ adaptation strategies': 'What does the literature say?\\nThe effectiveness of in situ adaptation plays an important role in determining whether and when individuals will move in response to climate stressors, which may be a form of adaptation (see Afifi Whilst GebreMichael et al. ( 2011) have found similar adaptation strategies of pastoralists in Niger and Ethiopia, they question Oxfam\\'s distinction of adaptation measures: because the pastoralists\\' system has always been changing, \"it is not easy to distinguish these practices from more recent processes of local innovation, which is equally a reflection of flexibility and adaptability\" (GebreMichael, 2011, p. 6). Furthermore, as a result of the heterogeneity of the communities and ecologies in the pastoral areas, \"it is extremely difficult for outsiders to recognise local adaptation, as these may be only small incremental changes in what appear to be \\'traditional\\' practices\" (2011, p. 6).\\nGebreMichael et al. moreover emphasize that there are many difficulties in separating climate change impacts from other pressures on pastoral systems. The authors argue that \"the root causes of pastoralists\\' vulnerability to climate stressors lie in their marginalization in decision-making and in the unfavourable government policies\", and therefore their inability to adapt, as well as their adaptation methods, cannot be understood by focusing only on the technical adaptation to climate change.\\nIn general, programmes introduced to reduce drought vulnerability have changed as compared to the programmes used in the 1970s (Turner, 2010). For example, nowadays there is more reliance on community-based initiatives to respond to climatic changes, such as the establishment of grain banks, microfinance schemes and small-scale irrigation. However, in the past there were more tendencies to apply large-scale irrigation systems, new crop cultivars and borehole programmes (Ribot, 2002).',\n",

Nonetheless, this made farmers dependent on other people.

We first tried to pursue local strategies and tried to move our cropping activities closer to the river and tried to water the plants manually. \" Some NGOs showed farmers new techniques that helped them adapt to the situation where it became very dry and difficult to apply the traditional farming techniques and basic adaptation strategies.

I used money from the sale of animals.\\nI could not work in another place because of fear of the government and of violence.\\nI tried to work as a pastoralist but the money was not enough to send to my family.

       "  'V. Migration and displacement': 'What does the literature say?\\nTerms and concepts such as environmental or climate change migration, environmentally induced or forced migration, ecological or environmental refugees, and climate change refugees are often used in academic literature on the subject; however, there is no general agreement on a precise definition.\\nThe lack of one clear definition can directly be related to the main ambiguities associated with the term \"environmental migration\": Firstly, \"the main reason for the lack of definition relating to migration caused by environmental degradation or change is linked to the difficulty of isolating environmental factors from other drivers of migration\" (Dun and Gemenne, 2008). Secondly, there is the problem of whether environmental migration is considered forced or voluntary migration. Hugo (2008, p. 11) argues that \"population mobility is probably best viewed as being arranged along a continuum ranging from totally voluntary migration, in which the choice and will of the migrants is the overwhelmingly decisive element encouraging people to move, to totally forced migration, where the migrants are faced with death if they remain in their present place of residence. [...] Environmentally induced migration is concerned with moves toward the forced end of this continuum\".\\nWhilst a precise definition may be important for practitioners and policymakers to develop policy responses and decide on the legal rights of such migrants, currently terms such as \"climate change refugee\" or \"environmental refugee\", which are widely used in the media and in some academic literature, are misnomers under international law and risk undermining the legal definition of a refugee and the protection regime which exists for such persons (Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009). UNHCR has also rejected the notion of environmental refugee and holds the view that the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees protects those fleeing from climate change-induced events only in specific situations which can be interpreted as \"persecution\" on one of five grounds set out in the Convention (UNHCR, 2008). Tacoli (2009, p. 516), looking in more depth at the questions of climate change and migration, argues that the \"key problem with the concept of environmental refugees is the implicit assumption that there is a direct causal link between environmental change and migration. This oversimplified view is based on \\'common sense\\' rather than on an understanding of the complex relationship between environmental change (and perceptions of it) and human agency, which includes adaptation that reduces the need to move away from affected areas, as well as the multiple factors that affect migration decisions. It also overlooks the fact that migration requires financial resources and social support, both of which may decline with climate change, which may thus result in fewer rather than more people being able to move\".\\nA number of academic studies have focused on climate change as a new driver, in the complex mix of factors, prompting movement away from places of habitual residence, along a continuum of forced displacement (in the event of sudden-onset disasters) through to voluntary migration (where the impacts are more slowonset). The nature of this movement is influenced by a range of factors, including: financial resources, social networks, accessibility of the destination and ethnic, linguistic or historical ties (Foresight 2011;Newland, 2011). Increasingly, experts note that, contrary to initial predictions that climate change would lead to mass exoduses across borders, most climate change-related migration is likely to be internal or over a nearby border, and even then mainly circular in nature (Jäger et al. 2009;Warner et al. 2009a;Warner et al. 2010;Kniveton et al. 2009;Kailin, 2009;McAdam, 2011).',\n",
       "  '_ 40': 'The attention to the nexus between displacement and migration induced by environmental factors, including climate change and conflict or human security, has also increased. A recent report by the United Nations Secretary-General, \"Climate Change and its Possible Security Implications\", and another prepared by the High Representative and the European Commission to the European Council, \"Climate Change and International Security\", define migration as one of the channels through which climate change works as a threat multiplier for existing threats to security, exacerbating economic, political and social problems (EC, 2008;UN, 2009). However, empirical evidence to draw conclusions on this nexus is not yet sufficient (Barnett and Adger, 2007).\\nWith respect to environmental migration in the Horn of Africa, Kibreab argued in 1997 that the large-scale migration taking place in the region had been falsely directly linked to environmental degradation. Instead, Kibreab argued, the displacement was the result of a disruption of long-standing traditional resource management systems for coping with spatial and temporal variability by conflict and \"scorched-earth\" government policies. Weiss and Reyes (2009) on the other hand strongly emphasize that both gradual environmental change and extreme environmental events influence population movements in the region.\\n\"Due to already significant levels of social vulnerabilities, poverty, and harshly arid ecosystems, the negative consequences of increased population pressures, compounded by environmental degradation, are more severely evidenced in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa\" (Weiss and Reyes, 2009, p. 100). Drought, in particular, is considered to be a major cause of rural-urban migration in both temporary-distress and permanent forms, especially in Ethiopia. Environmental migration in this fragile region can therefore exacerbate existing environmental problems as well as contribute to conflicts and increased pressure on resources.',\n",
       "  'Internal movement': 'Overwhelmingly, stories of mobility associated with moving away from worsening impacts associated with climate variability followed a specific pattern. That is, where movement related to climatic stressors did occur, such movement was taken as a last resort (only after all efforts to remain and adopt other methods of adaptation had been exhausted), particularly where the land being left was self-owned and only after all efforts to remain and try a number of alternative forms of adaptation had failed. Where movement occurred, in most cases it was likely to be internal, circular and temporary rather than cross-border and permanent.\\n\"Permanent movement to another place [because of drought] was not an option because we owned our own land. \"\\nLau woman from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia Many refugees interviewed reported several stages of localized, in-country migration before fleeing across a border. Some of the interviewees reported that their first decision to move internally was driven by worsening impacts of climate variability (i.e. prolonged and severe drought and lack of crops or fodder). This internal movement would typically be to an urban centre in search of an alternative livelihood. Many spoke of confronting political violence only once they reached these larger townships, which then caused them to flee across a border. For these people, climate stressors can be seen to play a key role in their trajectory towards becoming a refugee.\\n\"Because of severe drought, my family and I moved permanently to the river some distance away. But this was difficult because of fighting going on in that area and eventually we moved because of it. \"\\nLau woman from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia Circular movement is something that many refugee families reported having done during normal dry seasons. They would often travel to areas which were wetter and swampier. Such movement was reliant on a number of factors including: (a) owning land or having access (ability to rent) land or family ties in other areas, (b) those areas being relatively close to the place of habitual residence (i.e. usually not more than 10-30 km away), and (c) having in place social structures to enable this to occur (i.e. an older child to care for children at home for a number of weeks or months while the parents were away).\\nOne woman spoke about regular experiences of flooding. When this happened, she and her husband would move to an area 15 kilometres away from their farm. They would leave an older child at home to look after the other children. The land they moved to was provided by elders in the family.\\n\"At times we would move to an area near the river -it would take two days by foot to get there. We would stay there for three to seven days and then return. \"\\nLau woman from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia \"During the dry season I would go with the cattle to a big river near the border with South Sudan [Bahr al Ghazal]. It took me around three days of travelling. I would stay there for around three months. Many people did this in the same manner. The family was always left behind. \"\\nDarfuri farmer from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia \"We moved from the southern part of Eritrea to the west, near the border with Sudan, which was more fertile. We rented this land. I found it difficult to send money to my family because of Government check-points. Government had many restrictions on movement. If I had not been able to rent land from my brother\\'s widow, I would not have moved. \"\\nElderly farmer from Eritrea, My Ayni Camp, Ethiopia Temporary relocation is the next stage along the continuum in response to climate stressors. Such migration was normally reported to have been undertaken by the male head of household in search of an alternative livelihood such as casual labour or new skills, where drought had become too prolonged. In such cases, original farmland was kept and maintained by remaining family members (usually the wife and children). Only when social ties would start to suffer or break down would the relocation of the entire family take place.\\nVery few of the refugees interviewed made decisions to move away from their homelands permanently because of the impacts of climate variability. Only those with assets (including intangible assets such as family connections capable of supporting those who relocated for a period) and transferable skills (including education) managed to make decisions to leave earlier (before livelihoods completely failed) and for longer. Those without such resources reported that they had no choice and no other destinations to go to, so they remained until political violence forced them to flee for their immediate safety. In the context of IDPs interviewed from the Mount Elgon region in South Eastern Uganda, who were resettled in Kyriandongo by the Ugandan government as a result of severe flooding resulting in landslides in the Mount Elgon region, they noted that without the government\\'s intervention they would never have come to Kyriandongo because of the distance away from their homelands and their lack of skills, assets and family ties with people in this area.\\nThe interviews revealed that where permanent relocation in response to climate stressors was being considered, such a coping mechanism was not only limited to those who were better off.\\nIn fact, the very poorest, once they had made the decision to move, would be more likely to relocate permanently (albeit internally) because of lack of networks, assets, education and skills which would keep them tied to a place.\\n\"We were involved in agricultural activities in Bimbi. We grew fruit trees and cereals. We owned land near the Shibele River. Our family received irrigation water from the river. However, recently water availability declined because of less rain. Rain did not start at the normal time. This reduction in water led to a decline in agricultural output compared to input … I [the husband] moved to a nearby market town to sell products. The town was five hours away [walking]. I also worked as a carpenter in the town. When the rain came I would return to farm in Bimbi. But because of my absence, my wife was not able to sustain the farming work by herself. So at one point, when it hadn\\'t rained for a long time, the whole family decided to move to the market town. Different families had different levels of resilience to the drought. Our threshold was low because we had young children to feed. \" ',\n",
       "  'Cross-border movement': 'Cross-border movement, directly as a response to climate-related impacts, was rarely mentioned during the course of the interviews. Where refugees did recount stories of crossing an international border, it was usually because they were already living close to that border and were more familiar with places, customs and people in the neighbouring country than in other regions in their own countries. For most of those interviewed, cross-border migration was typically a secondary movement, caused by violence, drought or a combination of both.\\n\"When the drought came [in 1993] in Sudan, it spread everywhere. There was nowhere to move in Sudan. \"\\nNuer woman from Sudan, Fugnido Camp, Ethiopia \"When there was drought in Southern Sudan, we would often come to Ethiopia. \" \"The drought made the conflict worse.

       "  'VI. Concluding comments': \"The East and Horn of Africa is projected to be a region which will be particularly exposed to the negative impacts of climate variability. Agricultural production and food security are likely to be severely compromised. The citizens of countries in the East and Horn of Africa have particularly low capacities to cope with and adapt to projected stresses as they are already facing high levels of poverty and are repeatedly victims of violent conflicts. The fact that the states in the region often lack the resources to assist their citizens in times of crisis further aggravate their vulnerabilities.\\nToday, the East and Horn of Africa is already a region of particular concern for UNHCR not only because of the number of refugees originating from the region but also because of the severity of crises that occur there.\\nThe aim of this exploratory study was to understand the extent to which refugees and IDPs in the East and Horn of Africa have perceived, experienced and responded to climatic events and trends in recent years. For this purpose, expert interviews as well as focus group discussions with refugees and IDPs in Ethiopia and Uganda were carried out in spring 2011. Experts, as well as refugees, have observed significant changes in climate. They reported an increase in frequency and severity of extreme climatic events and observed shifts in seasons as well as unreliable and untimely rainfall. These climatic trends and events not only had a negative impact on agricultural production and food security, but also led to deteriorating social cohesion and the occurrence of resource-use conflicts. Pastoralists and farmers, who are the most exposed groups to climatic stresses, have developed a wide range of coping and adaptation strategies including mitigation of the negative impacts of the stress (e.g., building water reservoirs), changes in production practices (e.g., terracing), diversification of and complete changes to livelihood strategies.\\nMobility is an important strategy that has been used to adapt to and cope with climatic stress in the past. Pastoralism, for example, is a livelihood strategy based on mobility that has evolved as an adapted way to co-exist with conditions of high climate variability characteristics in the East and Horn of Africa. More recently, people have used internal migration -often to the urban centres -as a way to cope with the negative impacts of climatic events. For many of those interviewed, internal movement would often result in individual's confronting political violence in larger urban settings, which would then cause them to flee across a border. This study found that cross-border movement hardly ever occurs as a direct reaction to climatic stress. It was evident from the reports of refugees interviewed that broader political conditions, breakdown in civil order as well as excessive state oppression, severely reduced their ability to cope with and adapt to climatic crises.\\nThe links between primary internal movement/displacement related to climate variability, followed by a secondary cross-border movement are complex and should also be more thoroughly  \",\n",

       " 3: {'abstract': \"Extreme weather events such as flooding have been observed to deplete households' assets and render households vulnerable to shocks and poverty. Few empirical studies have however examined households' asset vulnerability and adaptation to such extreme events in Ghana. Based on qualitative research with two ecologically fragile communities in Ghana, this paper explores the asset vulnerability and adaptation strategies of households against periodic flooding. Findings suggested that households' assets most vulnerable to flooding were farmlands, human health, housing and financial savings. However, flooding did not affect households' assets equally; the effects were gendered and differentiated, often occasioned by inequalities in exposure, vulnerability, access to resources, capabilities and opportunities. Nonetheless, many households are actively adapting their assets by acquiring new knowledge about early warning systems, employing different farming practices and diversifying their assets. Understanding the differences in households' asset vulnerability as well as in the priorities that men and women, as well as the young and old, place on different asset adaptation strategies could therefore be important in the effectiveness of climate change adaptation as well as the sustainability of communities.\",\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"Over the last three decades, climate change has become one of the most widely discussed global development challenges (Prowse & Scott, 2008). The recently published Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Report (2014) highlights the saliency of the subject of climate change in contemporary global development. The severity of the impact of climate change and extreme weather events is however projected to be felt more in the global south, particularly in rural Africa (FitzRoy & Papyrakis, 2010;IPCC, 2014).\\nOne of the projected adverse impacts of climate change is floods (IPCC, 2014; Kundzewicz et al., 2014). The IPCC (2012) defines floods as the overflowing of the normal confines of streams or other body of water or the accumulation of water over areas that are not normally submerged. In the last few years, several countries in Africa, Asia and South America have experienced large and damaging floods. In 2011 for example, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Cambodia, China, India, Korea, Pakistan and Thailand all experienced devastating floods, with fatalities exceeding 1000 in places such as Columbia and the Philippines (Arnall, Thomas, Twyman, & Liverman, 2013;Kundzewicz, 2012). In 2012, destructive floods inducing more than 50 fatalities each, also occurred in Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Bangladesh, China, India, North and South Koria, Argentina and Haiti (Kundzewicz, 2012). In addition to these, one study recently projects a large increase in flood hazard in South Asia and Southeast Asia, as well as in parts of South America in the twenty-first century and beyond (Hirabayashi et al., 2013). In tropical Africa in particular, projections indicate an expected increase in the risk of floods (Hirabayashi et al., 2013). In fact some 800 million people worldwide or 11% of the world's population are currently living in flood-prone areas, and about 70 million or 1% of the global population are exposed to floods each year (Kundzewicz et al., 2014). Even at constant hazard, it has been projected that the population living in flood-prone areas would grow to 940 million, while those exposed to flooding yearly would grow to 86 million, based on demographic change alone (Hirabayashi et al., 2013). Reported flood losses (adjusted for yearly inflation) have also increased from an average of US$7 billion per year in the 1980s to some US$24 billion per year in the period 2001-2011 (Kundzewicz et al., 2014). Among the contributing factors to increased floods risks are massive urban development, reduced river-storage capacity, land subsidence from unregulated groundwater extraction, extreme events, rising see levels and increased intense precipitation (Dahm, 2014).\\nLike many rural communities in Africa, rural areas in Ghana are increasingly becoming vulnerable and fragile environments for making a living (Armah et al., 2009;Westerhoff & Smit, 2009). A number of recent analyses of rainfall and temperature trends have suggested a decrease in precipitation in Ghana for the period 1980-2000 (as compared to 1950-1970) (Owusu & Waylen 2009, 2013). In particular, seasonal and local climatic variability has been widely reported. For instance, Kunstmann & Jung (2005) found that total annual precipitation in the catchment area of the Volta Basin was increasing by 5% but decreasing (up to 70%) in April. One high-resolution regional climate model for the Volta region of Ghana also suggested an annual mean temperature increase of 1.2-1.3°C (Jung & Kunstmann, 2007). Indeed, data from Ghana's Climate Change Assessment Report indicate a warming climate, with mean annual temperature rising by 1.0°C between 1960 and 2011 (Stanturf et al., 2011). Using data from a quality-controlled network of 14 gauges from the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) for the period 1961-2010, Manzanas, Amekudzi, Preko, Herrera, and Gutiérrez (2014) also analysed precipitation variability trends in Ghana. Their analysis revealed, respectively, the existence of predominant decreasing and increasing precipitation trends in the GMet data for the first  and second  half of the period of study.\\nIn Ghana, these observed and/or simulated precipitation and temperature changes are triggering a wide range of extreme weather events, including flooding, and this exposes many rural households to new forms of risks and vulnerabilities (Stanturf et al., 2011;Westerhoff & Smit, 2009). Indeed, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014) notes that extreme weather events resulting from climate change threaten the livelihood security and survival of the world's poor and increase their vulnerability to displacement, food insecurity, water shortages and health hazards. In view of the livelihood threats of climate change-related extreme weather events, it has been argued that without appropriate livelihoods and asset adaptation strategies, extreme weather events pose a threat of reducing sustainable livelihood options for the rural poor in Ghana (Armah et al., 2009;Assan, Caminade, & Obeng, 2009;Kumamoto & Mills, 2012;Westerhoff & Smit, 2009).\\nSince the impacts of climate change are not completely preventable, one approach to minimizing the effects is adaptation (IPCC, 2014). Part B of the 2014 IPCC report which focuses on regional aspects of climate change -particularly highlights the relevance of adaptation in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change, particularly in West Africa (see Niang et al., 2014). Adaptation in this context is adjustments to ecological, social and economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC, 2014). In the literature, the terms 'adaptation' and 'coping' are sometimes used interchangeably. The IPCC report however makes important distinctions: coping is short-term response and non-continuous process whereas adaptation practices and results are sustained and the process is continuous; coping is oriented towards survival whereas adaptation is oriented towards long-term livelihood security; coping is motivated by crisis and is usually reactive whereas adaptation involves planning; and coping is often prompted by a lack of alternative whereas adaptation focuses on finding alternatives, including combining old and new strategies and knowledge.\\nAdaptation to extreme weather events is therefore fundamental to long-term poverty reduction and sustainable community development (Brown, 2011;IPCC, 2012IPCC, , 2014)). Consequently, there have been calls for more community-based empirical research to understand how extreme weather events such as flooding affect households' assets and the ways in which households adapt their assets to cope with such adverse events (Kumamoto & Mills, 2012;Mallick et al., 2005;Sowers, Vengosh, & Weinthal, 2011). In Ghana, a number of recent studies have examined vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events as well as local community adaptation practices. For example, Derbile and Kasie (2012) examined vulnerability of crop production to heavy precipitation in north-eastern Ghana. They found that heavy precipitation events often led to low food crop productivity, which rendered farmers vulnerable to food insecurity. Although various local adaptation strategies were observed, these were largely inadequate for eliminating vulnerability of crop production to heavy precipitation. Westerhoff and Smit (2009) also studied dynamic vulnerability and adaptation to multiple stressors in the Afram Plains of Ghana. They found that while community members experience a range of biophysical and socio-economic conditions that contribute to vulnerability, individual community members were also actively adapting their livelihoods to minimize vulnerability. Armah, Yawson, Yengoh, Odoi, and Afrifa (2010) also studied the impact of floods on livelihoods and vulnerability of natural resource dependent communities in northern Ghana. Their study suggests that some characteristics of the socio-cultural environment, especially the role of social networks, mitigated risk and vulnerability. Their results further suggest that both in case of seasonal variations in agricultural output and floods, individuals that have effectively diversified their livelihoods, both occupationally and geographically, were less sensitive than individuals who mainly achieved entitlement to food via crop cultivation. Codjoe, Atidoh, and Burkett (2012) also assessed gender and occupational perspectives on adaptation to climate extremes in the Afram Plains of Ghana. Their study suggested that preferred adaptation strategies to climate extremes differed by both gender and occupation, and that the success with which communities cope with the impacts of climate change is influenced by existing conditions, forces and characteristics which are peculiar to each community.\\nThe studies referred to above have provided pioneering insights into the issues of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change and extremes in Ghana, and our study builds on these previous researches. However, our study departs theoretically from these previous studies by analysing households' asset vulnerability and adaptation to flooding in rural Ghana through the lens of an asset-based vulnerability and adaptation (AVA) framework (more on this later). The use of such an analytical framework to examine household's asset vulnerability and adaptation to extreme weather events such as flooding is rare in the context of Ghana. In addition, the paper highlights how different assets are valued based on gender, age and occupation, as well as the ways in which households' asset vulnerability and adaptation capacities are gendered and differentiated. Such an analysis is also lacking despite the fact that considerable literature exists on vulnerability and adaptation to floods and weather-related disasters (Sultana, 2010). As climate change is likely to exacerbate extreme weather events including flooding, it is critical that such differentiations are understood so as to better inform current and future adaptation approaches and strategies aimed at lessening the effects of extreme weather events (Sultana, 2010). Our findings, which are discussed below, greatly improve understanding of the differentiated vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies of households during stressful extreme weather events such as flooding.\",\n",
       "  'Theoretical approach': \"Vulnerability and adaptation to extreme weather events have been addressed from different perspectives. Initial conceptualizations of vulnerability to environmental change tended to focus on either the nature of the physical hazard or the inherent societal characteristics (Westerhoff & Smit, 2009). Later conceptualizations however recognized the interaction of social and biophysical forces. For example, the 'disaster pressure and release' model proposed by Blaikie, Cannon, and Davis (1994) suggested that natural disasters are the result of the interactions of two processes: those generating inherent vulnerability of a society and those leading to the physical exposure to hazard. Similarly, the 'hazard of place' model by Cutter (1996) considered vulnerability as a combination of biophysical risk and social characteristics that render a society cognizant of and susceptible and able to respond to that risk within a specific place. More recently, a number of new theoretical approaches have been developed, including disaster management and urban system approaches (IPCC, 2012; Simatele, 2010), Adger's (2003) social capital and collective action approach and Moser and Satterthwaite's (2008) AVA framework. In this paper, we draw on Moser and Satterthwaite's (2008) AVA framework, and related work by Adger (2003) and Dulal, Brodnig, Onoriose, and Thakur (2010) to examine the ways in which households' asset become vulnerable to flooding and how these assets are adapted to minimize vulnerability.\\nBroadly, the AVA framework has two main components: asset vulnerability and asset adaptation strategies (Figure 1). The asset vulnerability component of the framework involves an analysis of households' assets and the sensitivity of these assets to physical hazards such as flooding (Moser & Stein, 2010).\\nVulnerability in this context defines the degree to which a system (asset in this case) is susceptible to, and unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change, including variability and extremes (IPCC, 2014). Thus vulnerability is expressed as a function of a system's exposure to climate stimuli, and its adaptive capacity (Westerhoff & Smit, 2009). Within the AVA framework, vulnerability is closely linked to the availability and nature of critical assets. Generally, an asset is defined as the stock of financial, human, natural or social resources that can be acquired, developed, improved and transferred across generations (Moser, 1998). In this paper, we understand assets not simply as resources that generate flows of consumption and additional stock or are used to build livelihoods, but they give people the capability to be and act, to reproduce, challenge or change the rules that govern the control, use and transformation of resources. In this way, assets could include both tangible and intangible resources, with the assets of the poor commonly identified as natural, physical, social, financial and human (Adger, 2003;Dulal et al., 2010;Moser, 1998). Physical assets include the stock of plant, equipment, infrastructure and other productive resources owned by individuals or households. Financial assets comprise the financial resources available to people (savings and supplies of credit). Human assets include investments in education, health and nutrition of individuals. Social assets include intangible assets, defined as the rules, norms, obligations, reciprocity and trust embedded in social relations, social structures and societies' institutional arrangements (Dulal et al., 2010). In several related literatures, this social asset is often referred to as 'social capital' (Adger, 2003). Natural assets are the stock of environmentally provided assets such as soil, atmosphere, forests, minerals, water and wetlands. Moser and Satterthwaite (2008) therefore argue that vulnerability to sudden shocks from external factors such as flooding pushes individual households into a state of uncertainty, and increasing risk of asset depletion and destitution. This argument suggests that the greater the erosion of households' assets during flooding events, the greater the vulnerability or insecurity of a household. However, such vulnerability may not be uniform in a given population and could be mediated by such factors as gender, age, occupation and access to more diversified assets base, which could be relied on to pursue adaptation strategies. As Prowse (2008) argues, a broad asset base is critical in adaptive response of the poor against extreme weather events. The second component of the framework therefore goes beyond vulnerability to analyse the roles individual household's assets play in increasing adaptive capacity. In particular, the adaptive response component of the framework explores the practical adaptation strategies, which households employ to adapt their assets against extreme weather events (Moser & Stein, 2010). In this connection, the AVA framework recognizes the interconnectivity between the different assets that households own in the adaptation process, and the ways in which the presence of one asset could greatly facilitate the adaptation of other assets to minimize vulnerability. For example, related research by Adger (2003) and Dulal et al. (2010) have shown how adaptation to climate change does not only depend on how much physical or financial assets individuals and households own or how vulnerable individuals and households are. Rather, adaptation is a dynamic social process that is facilitated, in part, by the presence of social assets or social capital, the ability of societies to act collectively and the presence of supportive formal and informal institutions.\\nIn adopting the AVA framework in this paper, we acknowledge that Moser and Satterthwaite (2008) developed their theoretical model from climate change adaptation among urban poor. We however believe the AVA framework is analytically useful in the context of rural Ghana for the following conceptual and practical reasons. First, our focus in this paper is on the assets of the poor hence our subject of analysis is very similar to that of Moser and Satterthwaite. Second, the focus on assets in the AVA framework has greater analytical appeal, as it seems to address some of the problems associated with the use of income levels and consumption expenditures to undertake poverty and vulnerability analysis. For example, income levels and consumption expenditures do not typically reveal much about the well-being of the poor and the complex circumstances under which they construct their livelihoods (Moser, 1998;Moser & Satterthwaite, 2008). This problem is compounded by the fact that income levels and consumption expenditures are difficult to measure in the context of rural Ghana due to the informality of most rural economies. A focus on the assets rural households own therefore offers a better approach to understanding vulnerability and adaptation during flooding. This is because assets reflect the totality of livelihood conditions and vulnerabilities of a particular household, and a particular household's assets give an indication of who in a given community is more likely to be vulnerable or adapt to climate change (Moser & Satterthwaite, 2008;Prowse, 2008).\",\n",
       "  'Research context': \"This paper is based on a larger research that was conducted between July 2011 and December 2011 in two communities -Buipe and Yapeiin the Central Gonja District (CGD) of Ghana. The aim was to explore households' asset vulnerability and adaptation during flooding. The CGD is located at the southwestern part of the Northern Region of Ghana. The district has an estimated total population of 87,877, of which 44,017 are females (Ghana Statistical Service, 2012). The population of the district is predominantly rural -90% is located in rural communities with less than 500 people (Ghana Statistical Service, 2012). Agriculture is the main occupation of the peopleit employs some 90% of the labour force (CGD Assembly, 2010). Agriculture is mainly rain-fed. Farm plots are small in size, scattered and managed by smallholder peasant farmers (CGD Assembly, 2010). More than 80% of farmers use hoes and cutlasses in cultivation. A greater number of farmers have little access to tractor services while a few use bullocks ploughs in land preparation (CGD Assembly, 2010). At the time of this research, about 79% of the district's population (aged 6 years and above) had never been to school (CGD Assembly, 2010).\\nThe district was chosen mainly because it lies within one of the ecologically fragile zones of the northern region, where flooding occurs regularly (Stanturf et al., 2011). The CGD is located within the Guinea Savannah ecological zone of Ghana and is characterized by a lowlying area with altitude ranging between 150 and 300 m above sea level (Stanturf et al., 2011). It is traversed by two of the largest rivers in the country, namely the White and Black Volta (Stanturf et al., 2011). These rivers are the source of periodic flooding in the district, often triggered by intensive rainfall (CGD Assembly, 2010). While the entire district is flood-prone, Buipe and Yapei have had the longest history of the occurrence of flooding, including the 1974, 1979, 2003, 2007, 2009and 2010floods (NADMO, 2010)). The destructive effects of these floods have been widely documented by Ghana's National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO). In 2010 for example, 55 communities were affected by floods; about 700,000 people were displaced; 3234 houses collapsed, 23,588 acres of farmlands were destroyed and 1109 domestic animals including cattle, goats, sheep and chickens were destroyed at an estimated cost of GH¢ 206,780 (US$103,390) (NADMO, 2010). Buipe and Yapei were however the most affected communities. By the end of November 2010 when the floods had fully subsided in Buipe, about 12,418 people were displaced, and 1196 houses and 8100 acres of farms were destroyed (NADMO, 2010). In Yapei too, 784 people were displaced and 2980 acres of farms were destroyed (NADMO, 2010).\\nThe problem of flooding is compounded by the fact that majority (44.2%) of the inhabitants are poor and lack adequate infrastructure and social protection (Ghana Statistical Service, 2015). In addition to the regular threats of flooding and poverty, the economic and socio-political organization of the district makes it an interesting case study. Like most societies in Northern Ghana, many aspects of life are organized around the household, family, kinship and the community. The kinship system is patrilineal, and women are still generally more disadvantaged from a young age. Educational and economic opportunities for women are limited, and early and/or arranged marriages are common. The organization of kinship structure around patrilines, property, ownership and right very often marginalizes women. As we show below, these social and economic disadvantages play important roles in households' assets vulnerability and adaptation to flooding.\",\n",
       "  'Methods': '',\n",
       "  'Research design': \"To document households' collective and individual experiences with periodic flooding and AVA in a normal peergroup interpersonal exchange, a qualitative research design, similar to the community-based approach used by Burton, Huq, Lim, Pilifosova, and Schipper (2002), Ford and Smit (2004) and Westerhoff and Smit (2009), was adopted. The usefulness of a qualitative approach to vulnerability and adaptation analysis in the context of extreme weather events in Ghana has been demonstrated in the literature (see e.g. Westerhoff & Smit, 2009). A key element of our qualitative research approach was to engage community members as necessary sources of information on the kinds of assets they own, the ways in which these assets are differentially exposed when flooding occurs, the adaptive strategies they employ and the conditions that constrain or facilitate their adaptation strategies. To this end, focus group discussions (FGDs) were the main data collection methods (Morgan & Krueger, 1993). Discussions in focus groups focused on exploring households experiences of flooding, the kind of assets rural people own, the roles of these assets in their livelihood construction, the ways in which flooding affects these assets and the strategies through which these assets are adapted to mitigate the adverse effects of flooding. In addition to a facilitator asking questions to elicit discussants' views using a pre-tested topic guide, several participatory activities were undertaken in the FGDs including participatory ranking of assets and adaptation strategies. Because of the interactive nature of the FGDs, participants were able to query and challenge each other as well as explain themselves, making it possible to assess how far views and opinions were shared or disputed. While our use of FGDs had several strengths, we acknowledge that group bias as well as the effect of 'dominant discussants' could have affected the outcome of FGDs as noted by other researchers elsewhere (Morgan & Krueger, 1993).\",\n",
       "  'Research participants': \"The main research participants were households, which were affected during the 2010 floods in Buipe and Yapei. A household in this context refers to a person or group of persons who live together, share the same cooking and eating arrangements and consider themselves a single unit (Ghana Statistical Service, 2008, 2014). One reason for focusing on household as the unit of analysis is that it is the basic unit of production and consumption as well as the unit that owns assets and determines adaptation strategies against extreme weather conditions (Stanturf et al., 2011).\\nIn all 60 households -34 in Buipe and 26 in Yapeiparticipated in the study. The majority of households (48) were male-headed. In line with the AVA framework, each household was made to choose two representativesmale and female. This was to ensure that the perspectives of both males and females in relation to households' asset vulnerability to, and adaptation against flooding, were adequately captured. Given that our research setting is largely patriarchal, and given that a number of previous researchers have found that both vulnerability and adaption to climate change and related extreme weather events are often gendered (Neumayer & Plumper, 2007;Sultana, 2010), we felt that sampling an equal number of males and females into the study would allow us to explore the gender dimension of asset vulnerability and adaptation. In addition, we did not choose only household heads (traditionally defined as the head of a household) because initial discussions with community leaders suggested that in some instances household heads were not necessarily the key decision-makers in the household. Similarly, it was reported that some household heads usually played no role in the initial acquisition of household assets and decisions about how the asset should be managed. Households were therefore allowed to choose their own representatives based on their own valuation of the role of each household member in relation to decision-making regarding asset acquisition and adaptation to extreme weather conditions. This was achieved after the researchers held initial meetings with each of the selected households. In these meetings, the researchers thoroughly explained the sampling procedures to all household members and encouraged them to nominate two representatives (male and female) who they feel have played or would be expected to play important roles as regards acquisition of assets and adaptation of these assets in the event of extreme weather conditions such as flooding. The total number of household representatives was therefore 120 -60 males and 60 females. The ages of these participants ranged from 18 to 75 years -15% were aged 18-30 years; 65% were aged 31-43 years; another 15% were aged 44-56 years; 3% were aged 57-69 years and 2% were aged 70 +. Majority (77.6%) of the participants had no formal education. Majority (81.2%) of the participants were also smallholder farmers who practiced rain-fed agriculture.\\nTo gain multiple perspectives on asset-based vulnerability and adaption to flooding as well as triangulate the data collected from FGDs, however, other key informants such as community leaders (chiefs and assembly members), community health nurses, community health officers and the district disaster management coordinator were also interviewed.\",\n",
       "  'Sampling and recruitment': 'A mix of purposive and convenience sampling techniques was used to select households and key informants. The selection was based on a number of pre-set inclusion criteria: household should have been directly affected by at least one of the flood events; household should be available and willing to participate in the study and the two household representatives should have the ability/capacity to consent to participate in the research.\\nThe actual recruitment process involved advertising the study at vantage points (local community markets, churches and mosques) using community and religious leaders, and the local community gong gong beaters (i.e. local community announcers). Only households that expressed interest in the study were contacted and subsequently invited to participate in the study.',\n",
       "  'Data collection': 'As noted above, FGDs were the main data collection method. Data were collected over a period of four months.\\nIn all, 14 FGDs -8 in Buipe and 6 in Yapiewere completed with household representatives. The differences in the number of focus groups between the study communities is related to both differences in population size and the number of households who were affected by the 2010 floods. In each community, groups were segmented by age and sex. That is women aged 35 or younger and men aged 35 or younger, as well as women and men aged above 35 in separate groups, were formed. Segmentation was necessary because initial discussions with community leaders suggested that there were age and gender hierarchy conflicts in the study communities. For instance, younger men or women (18-35 years) were unlikely to freely express their views in the presence of older men or women (36 years above) because of cultural norms, which require young people to listen to their elders. Segmenting discussants by similar age groups and sex contributed to making participants more comfortable when expressing their opinions or sharing their experiences within the group context.\\nGroups consisted of 4-9 participants (1 group consisted of 4 discussants; another group consisted of 8 discussants and the remaining 12 groups had 9 discussants each). Discussions lasted 1.30-2 hours, and ended when a point of saturation was reached. All FGDs were held in the study communities at locations convenient to both the participants and the researchers. All the discussions were held in the local dialect -Gonja. One of the researchers facilitated all discussions in the focus groups.\\nTo complement the FGDs, key informant interviews were conducted with three community leaders, three women leaders, two assemblymen, two community health officers and one district disaster management coordinator. Interviews were conducted in both Gonja and English, and lasted between 30 and 40 minutes. All discussions and interviews were audio-recorded alongside handwritten field notes with the consent of participants.',\n",
       "  'Analysis': 'After the completion of interviews, all audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and all non-English transcripts translated into English. All transcripts and interview notes were then read and reviewed for overall understanding. This first step was completed with separate summaries for each transcript outlining the key points participants made. All transcripts were then exported into NVivo 9 qualitative data analysis software, where the data were both deductively and inductively coded, and dominant themes were noted and collated. The final analysis was done using a combination of thematic and content analysis (Bernard, 1994).',\n",
       "  'Results and discussion': \"Participants' accounts in relation to households' asset vulnerability to, and adaptation against, floods converged on a number of common themes, which are explored below.\",\n",
       "  'Assets and rural livelihood construction': \"To understand the vulnerabilities of rural households to extreme weather conditions and how they adapt their assets, the researchers first examined the assets households own and the roles these assets play in their livelihood construction. As argued earlier, assets are critical resources that help households to construct meaningful livelihoods. Not only do assets make rural livelihood meaningful, but they also generate stock of benefits that can be accumulated and transferred to future generations (Rakodi, 1999).\\nResults from FGDs and key informant interviews suggest that households rely on multiple stocks of assets to construct their livelihoods. Table 1 shows the multiple stocks of assets participants reported as critical in their livelihood construction. These assets can be broadly characterized as comprising human capital, social capital, natural capital, financial capital and physical capital. These categories of assets are generally consistent with those previously identified and discussed under the theoretical framework of this paper. However, further discussions with research participants uncovered several dynamics in relation to the relative importance of different assets for the livelihood construction of different individuals even in the same household.\\nFor instance, further analysis of data generated from participatory asset ranking exercises during FGDs revealed that a combination of household and individual characteristics such as gender, occupation, age and location determined which stock of assets were critical in their livelihood construction. Many older people (36+ years) ranked children and good health as the first (1) and second (2) most important assets for their livelihood construction (see Table 1). For instance, having children was reported to provide social and economic security in both old age and stressful times such as when flooding occurs. One elderly woman said: I am getting older day by day, and cannot do the hard work I used to do. My children are the ones to take care of me, and help me in everything I do. I don't know what I will do without those children. (Female,63years,FGD,Yapei) Older participants also regarded 'good health' as another critical asset. Commenting on good health as critical asset in household livelihood construction and adaptation to flooding, one male discussant also said:\\nHealth is wealth, and as farmers we are able to work well and face this challenge of flooding when we are healthy … If your house gets damaged and your family members are in danger, can you solve the problem if you are not healthy? (Male,73 years,FGD,Buipe) According to this account, possessing good health rendered individuals, especially the aged, less vulnerable during extreme weather events such as flooding. Also, good health enabled them to be independent. In this way, it was reported that one was likely to survive the adverse effects of flooding if one were in a state of good health and thus less dependent on the support of others. Several young people however reported land, good health, education, children and house as the most important assets for their livelihood construction. As one young female discussant said:\\nFor me what is really important is to have good health. Once I have good health, then education, children and a place to live … I mean a house. These are my priorities. (Female,27 years,FGD,Buipe) Access to land for such young people was not only a critical productive resource but also it provided collateral and economic security during crisis. Being in a state of good health was seen as providing a stock of wealth as well as enabling their access to, and ability to work, while education enhances individuals' knowledge, skills set and capabilities to respond to challenges and as well broadens individual opportunities to be gainfully employed.\\nFGDs with both men and women also showed gendered valuation of different household assets. For example, while most male participants ranked, in descending order, land, house, good health, livestock and savings as the most important assets for their livelihood construction, most women reported that having healthy children, especially male children, good family relations, land for food crop cultivation and education were the most critical assets for their livelihood construction (see Table 1). Most men argued that their very existence was intricately tied to land and that in addition to being used for food crop and livestock production as well as housing to provide shelter for their household, land could be used as collateral and economic security during crisis. For most rural communities in particular, land provides direct source of household income through collection and sale of fuel wood and fruits such as shea and baobab. Women valued children in general because such children often provide future social and economic security.\\nI say my children are my most important assets because they will take care of me in the future. (Female, 28 years, FGD, Yapei) Importantly, however, not all children were equally valued. Further discussions in both FGDs and key informant interviews revealed both men and women valued male children as the most critical compared to their female counterparts.\\nFor me my male children are my most precious possessions. Because of them I know my husband lineage will continue … they are the ones who will take over and Thus male children are particularly valued because they often guarantee some married women a place in their marriages due largely to the patrilineal system of kinship organization, which expects the male child to perpetuate the patrilineage. Such gendered valuation of children is therefore not surprising given that our study setting is patrilineal whereby male children are expected to perpetuate their respective patrilineages. However, it does have implications for access to resources, educational opportunities and even adaptive response when extreme weather events such as flooding occurs. As some participants reported, preferences for male children often result in lesser attention to females in situations of flooding. Differences in valuations of the role of assets in livelihood construction were also revealed in the accounts of different occupational and spatial groupings. For example, most households whose primary economic activity was farming reported farmland, good health and access to credit as the most critical assets in composing their livelihoods.\\nAs a farmer, my number one priority is having access to abundant and fertile land … I then must be healthy to be able to work on the land. The other important thing is support like access to credit to buy input and hire other services. (Male, 43 years, FGD, Yapei)\\nFor most households in urban settings such as Buipe, having a house and some savings were the most critical assets. For instance, having a house not only provides shelter. It also serves as collateral and economic security during crisis. Besides, within the urban environment where demand for housing is often high, it was reported that individuals or households who own houses could easily rent or lease them out to generate additional income in times of crisis. Taken together, our findings here suggest that individual and household characteristics do play a role in the definition and determination of which assets are important, and that people in the same household or community may value the same assets quite differently. This knowledge is clearly important for targeting purposes and should therefore be taken into account when planning responses to build households resilience and adaptation against extreme weather events such as flooding.\",\n",
       "  \"Household's assets vulnerability to flooding\": \"Vulnerability of human systems and assets to deteriorating environmental conditions is one of the projected effects of climate change and related extreme weather events (IPCC, 2014). This study therefore explored how flooding affected the assets of households in Buipe and Yapei. Table 2 presents a summary of the different ways in which flooding has rendered critical household assets vulnerable in Buipe and Yapei. In both FGDs and informant interviews, participants' narrative accounts suggested that the frequency of flooding has undoubtedly had serious adverse impact on their critical assets by exposing them to new risks, and worsening existing vulnerabilities.\\nOne young female participant narrated her experience thus:\\nEvery now and then the floods come and our properties are destroyed. A year ago [referring to 2010] the floods came and we lost everything. I have used all my money to support my husband whose farm got destroyed. This is making it difficult for us to make a descent living again … our children's education has been badly affected. (Female,21 years,FGD,Yapei) In all FGDs and most in-depth interviews with key informants, children, health, farmlands, housing and livestock were identified as the assets which were not only most vulnerable to flooding, but also which when affected, endangered their livelihood most. Apart from the direct asset vulnerabilities listed in Table 2, sudden exposure to floods was reported to generate a complex web of additional vulnerabilities. For instance, it was reported that depletion of savings and destruction of food crops as a result of floods created food insecurity, malnutrition and limited access to work. These vulnerabilities were reported to exacerbate abject poverty and environmental degradation as poor households seek desperate measures to survive on available natural resources. Accordingly, these vulnerabilities were often likely to be worse when recovery times are short before the occurrence of another adverse whether extreme event.\\nBut again, it was discovered that individual and household characteristics such as age and gender determined the extent to which one is susceptible to flooding. In this regard, most of the participants stated that farmers as compared to civil service workers, women as compared to men, women-headed households as compared to male-headed households, children as compared to adults and rural as compared to urban households, were the most vulnerable groups of people. Children, as assets, were reported to be most vulnerable to waterborne diseases and infection during flooding events. They were also more likely to drown and die from flooding than adults. In this way, households which depend on children to provide both domestic labour for current livelihood construction and future economic security were reported to be more vulnerable. Similarly, it was reported that exposure of farmlands and/ or food crops to floods exacerbated the vulnerability of households heavily dependent on agriculture. For instance, apart from the fact that food crops are destroyed and farmlands become inaccessible during flooding, it was reported that flooding often result in excessive erosion. This often reduced soil fertility and the value of agricultural and commercial lands. Thus farmers' vulnerabilities arose partly from the fact that their main livelihood activity (agriculture) is tied to the natural environment and the fact that extreme weather events such as flooding exert important influences on agricultural output.\\nFor women, especially women-headed households, vulnerabilities arose from a number of factors: the fact that women are often burdened with the task of finding safe drinking water and food when flooding occurs partly because of male migration; the fact that women often face additional health treats due partly to difficulties meeting their sanitation needs resulting from lack sanitation and privacy during flood events and the fact that many of them are already poor and have both low resources to make significant investment in diversifying their assets and the capacity to act quickly when the level of damage is extensive or make significant investment in adaptation strategies against severe shocks and stress that arise from weather extremes such as floods. As one participant noted during key informant interview session:\\nWhenever the floods come, we all suffer … but the sad reality is that those who suffer most are our women. Most of them have no education and usually do not have sufficient land and financial resources to make important live-transforming decisions during flooding events. (Male, 53 years, Informant Interview, Yapei) Another participant said: You know our children and we women are already a disadvantaged group. So whenever there is flooding, we suffer the most because we do not have sufficient resources to help us make decisions that would minimise our exposure to flooding. (Female, 32 years, Informant Interview, Buipe) Indeed, several accounts from women and key informants underscored the fact that the effects of natural disasters such as flooding are not gender neutral. Rather, the effects are gendered and differentiated, and these gendered effects are usually occasioned by inequalities in exposure and sensitivity as well as inequalities in access to resources, capabilities and opportunities that systematically disadvantage certain groups, especially women, women-headed households and children. Several accounts here appeared to link women's greater vulnerability to the fact that women in Buipe and Yapei generally suffer several multiple deprivations including lack of education and limited property owning rights. These multiple deprivations, in and of themselves, often constitute important sources of vulnerability, which are then exacerbated when flooding strikes.\\nIn planning responses to natural disasters such as floods in Buipe and Yapei, it is important to recognize and take into account the fact that floods do not affect households and communities equally as if by an arbitrary stroke of nature. Rather, flood impacts are contingent on the vulnerability of individual affected people or households, which can and often does systematically differ across economic, class, gender, age, occupational and rural and urban groups.\",\n",
       "  \"Households' asset adaptation strategies\": \"With increasing occurrence of weather extremes and their adverse impact on the assets and livelihood sources of households, the question that needs to be addressed is how households adapt their assets to cope with such stressful events. This question was indeed one of the central concerns of this study. This section discusses deliberate and practical actions that households adopt to adapt their assets against the adverse impact of flooding. Participants were asked to discuss how they adapt their household assets to cope with periodic flooding. Table 3 shows the various strategies households employ to protect their assets from depleting and to adapt against flooding. The table also shows participants preferred asset adaptation strategies. These were generated from participatory ranking exercises in FGDs where participants were asked to rank the various adaptation strategies from most preferred (1) to least preferred.\\nGenerally, most households adopt multiple adaptation strategies to lessen their exposure to hazards wrought by flooding, and to exploit new opportunities within and out of their livelihood systems. While a number of these asset adaptation strategies cut across gender, age and occupation, several of them were gendered and differentiated. This is consistent with Codjoe et al. (2012) assessment of gender and occupational perspectives on adaptation to climate extremes in the Afram Plains of Ghana in which they found that adaptation strategies to climate extremes were differentiated by gender and occupation. In the case of health (human asset) for instance, both men and women said they have joined Ghana's national health insurance scheme (NHIS) in order to have easy access to medical care in the event of injury or ill-health including cholera or malaria during or after flooding. I used to not register for the NHIS … because my family members were not getting sick. However, because of the frequent flooding and the unpredictable nature of damage it can cause these days, I decided to enrol all my family members on the scheme. Now if flooding happens and I lose everything and any of my family members fall sick, I will not be worried because I know I will not be saddled with hospital bills. (Male, 44 years, FGD, Buipe) Several male participants however reported that they were concurrently adopting different farming practices against flooding. One male participant illustrated this point in the quote below: I own two different plots of farmlands, one near the river basin on which I cultivate vegetables during the dry season because of access to water. But in the rainy season since the floods can come at any time, I farm on the second land upland far away. Though the second farmland sometimes gets submerged, it could have been worse if I cultivated on the first. (Male,39 years,FGD,Yapei) In this regard, access and ownership of more farmlands emerged as an important determinant of a household's ability to adapt. But reports from households headed by women who traditionally have limited access to, and ownership of land, and whose usufruct rights to land usually depend on inheritance or goodwill of a man, suggested that such women had limited adaptation capacity.\\nFor people like us women who do not own land in this community, it is difficult to quickly turn things around when our small farmlands are destroyed by floods. Because I don't have enough land, I am forced to grow crops on my small farmland despite the that fact that it has been destroyed by the floods on several occasions. (Female,42 years,FGD,Yapei) In this way, gender came out strongly as an important determinant of both access to landed resources and ability to successfully adapt during and after flooding events. The district NADMO coordinator in Buipe corroborated this gendered differentiation in relation to land ownership and adaptive capacity in one of our key informant interview sessions:\\nThe flooding affects all members in the community, but it is worse for women, especially those who don't have Some participants also indicated that they have shifted to growing only flood tolerant crops such as rice in order to mitigate the adverse effects of flooding. Others reported that they farm intensively on small plots of lands least affected and even extend farming to marginal areas. In this regard, it appears that not all the adaptive responses and strategies households used have positive impact on the environment. For instance, interviews with some households and key informants showed how intensive cultivation of small plots of farmlands and marginal lands have led to environmental degradation that reduces windows of opportunities for future generation. Other participants reported the importance of knowledge about early warning systems as very useful in reducing their vulnerability to flooding and other extreme weather conditions and increasing their ability to respond quickly. Several participants reported that they have invested money in buying radio sets in order to get more education on disaster preventive measures and early warning information about weather condition from the GMet and NADMO. Others also said they attended community meetings organized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on how to respond to disasters and to reconstruct their livelihoods after disaster. Several participants also reported their continuous participation in diverse livelihood activities to reduce their vulnerabilities. For instance, some younger male participants said that apart from farming, they also engaged in charcoal business so that when their farms are destroyed they can rely on savings made from their charcoal business. A number of female participants also reported engaging in trading petty household consumables such as pepper and salt alongside their farming activities. Interestingly, these adaptation strategies seem to reproduce existing genderbased and age-related roles differentiations. For instance, roles or activities that required physical strength were reported to be traditionally performed by males, especially young men. Since charcoal burning is an activity requiring physical strength, young men were reported to be more likely to turn to charcoal burning as an adaptive strategy while more females resort to such less physically demanding activities as selling household commodities.\\nWhen the floods occur, people turn to different strategies to survive. Usually, men in this community turn to alternative activities like charcoal burning. You know these activities are physically demanding and men are traditionally expected to perform them … most of us women also resort to activities like trading in household goods … you know these activities are less demanding and so most women are comfortable doing them. (Female,35,Informant Interview,Yapei) Migration was also reported as an adaptation strategy. In both male and female FGDs, several discussants reported that some members of their household do migrate to urban towns and cities during the rainy seasons when floods are rampant to seek employment opportunities to support their families.\\nThe last time the flood came and destroyed all my crops, my strategy was to travel down south. That way I was able to work in other peoples' farms and made some money, which I then used to buy food following my return. (Male,26 years,FGD,Buipe) Younger men were however more likely to migrate compared to their older counterparts. Although younger females were also reported to occasionally migrate during flooding events, women were generally reported as having lower propensities to migrate compared with their male counterparts.\\nIn times like this [referring to flooding], we encourage our young men to move to other towns where things are better. That way they can earn some income which they can use to support their families … These days, some of our young women also migrate … they also travel out … though more men than women travel out of the community during flooding. (Female, 52 years, FGD, Yapei) Indeed, migration (especially of young men) as a livelihood adaptation strategy in the aftermath of floods has been widely documented in the literature (Codjoe et al., 2012;Sultana, 2010). However, similar to findings from previous research (Sultana, 2010), migration of men was reported to place additional burden on women in terms of the performance of domestic and non-domestic responsibilities, including meeting households' food and nutritional requirements, and caring for the aged and children.\\nThe problem with this [referring to migration of young men] is that our women are left behind to struggle to cater for themselves, their children and even the aged. (Male,47 years,Informant Interview,Buipe) One other important adaptive strategy that participants in FGDs and informant interviews reported is the building up of social capital through informal social institutions such as friendship and kinship. Most participants in this study viewed social capital as a very powerful asset that increases their adaptive capacity. Links with neighbours, family relations and NGOs were reported as sources of support when the impact of damage is beyond individual's capability to recover on their own. Participants specifically reported that an individual's link with the church, neighbours and nearby communities broadened the support base on which one can rely during and after flood events. Embedded in this adaptive strategy is the concept of reciprocity, which enables households and community members to make claims of some minimum welfare entitlement during flooding because of their affiliation and association with others. One female participant in Buipe related her experience thus:\\nLast year my husband and I lost everything, our farm and house. Had it not been our family and friends, we could not have had a place to live with our and children.\\nDiscussions with participants suggested that community bonds and trust were important factors for decreasing vulnerability to extreme weather events, although there were important variations between the two study communities. For example, the effectiveness of relying on social capital and networks to build resilience against flooding appeared to be stronger in Buipe where in addition to informal social institutions, there exist more formal institutions such as NGOs and micro-credit unions. In Buipe, the complementary roles of formal and informal institutions provided more opportunities such as network engagement and information sharing, which households exploited to increase their livelihood resilience and adaptive capacity compared to those in Yapei. Several participants in Buipe said that they have joined micro-credit schemesservices not readily available in Yapeias a form of insurance measure and to also increase their access to credit to rebuild their livelihoods and assets acquisitions during and after flood disasters. The findings here support earlier studies that suggested that effective adaptation does not take place in vacuum but requires the support of a wide range of formal and informal institutions including government agencies and NGOs (see Adger, 2003;Westerhoff & Smit, 2009).\\nBut inevitably, the various adaptation strategies themselves present unique opportunities and challenges. Aside the fact that some of the strategies can only provide short-term relief and are therefore not sustainable, participants' priorities and preferred adaptation strategies diverged and converged in significantly interesting ways (see Table 3). With regard to convergence for example, all the different participants in this study agreed that 'abandoning farm land in flood prone areas and migrating to higher ground neighbouring communities' was the most preferred way to adapt their land (farmland and residential) against flooding. Similarly, most discussants agreed that 'relocating schools to higher grounds' was their most preferred way of adapting education against flooding. Convergence in terms of the priorities of men, women, the young and the aged on the above-mentioned asset adaptation strategies clearly provides opportunities for instituting contextually relevant, long-term and sustainable asset adaptation solutions against flooding in the study context. Indeed, the asset adaptation strategies on which the preferences of most participants strongly converged should be the starting point of real solutions to the problems of flooding and asset vulnerability in Buipe and Yapei.\\nThere are however a number of areas where there is divergence in terms of preferred adaptation strategy. For instance, discussants in female FGDs and discussants under age 35 ranked 'relocation to high grounds' as their most preferred way to adapt housing to flooding. Discussants in male FGDs and discussants above age 35 however ranked 'relocation to high grounds' as one of the least preferred way to adapt housing to flooding (see Table 3). While this seeming disjunction in the above-mentioned area of adaptation strategy could be the natural product of a context that is diverse, it clearly points to the potential for conflict and policy failure, particularly when external interventions are being implemented without regard to this differentiated preferences in adaptation strategy. Understanding the differences in the priorities that men and women, as well as the young and old place on different asset adaptation strategies may prove to be important in the effectiveness of climate change adaptation as well as the sustainability of communities (Codjoe et al., 2012).\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion and policy implications': \"The study reported in this paper is one of the first studies in Ghana to explore AVA strategies of households against adverse extreme weather-related events. The study responds to recent calls within the empirical research literature for more research to understand how extreme weather events such as flooding affect households' assets and the ways in which households adapt their assets against such adverse events (Dulal et al., 2010;Mallick et al., 2005). Taken together, the findings from this study suggest that many rural households do experience severe asset-related vulnerability due to occasional floods, and these vulnerabilities contributed to eroding households' assets, constrained asset accumulation and hampered sustainable livelihood construction as well as poverty reduction. However, flooding did not affect households' assets equally. Rather, the effects are gendered and differentiated, often occasioned by inequalities in exposure, vulnerability, access to resources, capabilities and opportunities. Nevertheless, the study also demonstrated that rural households are not passive victims of circumstances. Many households are actively adapting their assets using a combination of indigenous and modern knowledge systems and practices. These asset adaptation strategies, though may not be easily observable to the outsider because of the multidimensional and small scale at which they occur, could nevertheless become known through appropriately designed research that allows for the perspectives of households to be explored. We believe the use of the AVA framework in combination with the qualitative inquiry approach in this paper enabled a better understanding of the kind of assets rural people own, the roles of these assets in their livelihood construction, the ways in which flooding affect these assets and the ways in which households adapt these assets to mitigate the adverse effects of flooding.\\nWhile acknowledging that these findings may have been framed by some of the contextual factors highlighted earlier as well as methodological limitations such as group biases, the different asset vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies documented here have the potential to inform learning and change. For example, knowledge that vulnerabilities and response strategies to flooding are differentiated by age, gender, occupation and location could be used to design interventions that target the most vulnerable segments of the society such as women and children. For example, policies and programmes could be implemented to expand women's access to land, education and credit. Such policies have the potential to contribute both to women's asset accumulation and adaptive capacity during flooding. Understanding the differences in households' asset vulnerability as well as in the priorities that men and women, as well as the young and old, place on different asset adaptation strategies could therefore be important in the effectiveness of climate change adaptation as well as the sustainability of communities. Without this type of understanding and differentiated policy responses, adaptation to extreme weather events such as flooding is likely to be ineffectual or even maladaptive.\",\n",

       " 4: {'abstract': 'We investigate the role that climatic change has played in the pattern of urbanization in sub-Saharan African countries compared to the rest of the developing world. To this end we assemble a cross-country panel data set that allows us to estimate the determinants of urbanization. The results of our econometric analysis suggest that climatic change, as proxied by rainfall, has acted to change urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa but not elsewhere in the developing world. Moreover, this link has become stronger since decolonization, which is likely due to the often simultaneous lifting of legislation prohibiting the free internal movement of native Africans.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"It has been noted that historically economic development and urbanization have tended to go hand in hand, and the legitimacy of this link continues to draw considerable attention; see, for instance, the 1999/2000 issue of the World Development Report (World Bank [36]). One notable exception to this stylized fact, however, has been sub-Saharan Africa. More specifically, while sub-Saharan Africa's growth rate of urbanization, defined as the share of urban to total population, has been extraordinary by international standards, averaging 140 percent between the 1960s and the 1990s-which is a rate of ten times that of OECD countries and 2.5 times that of the rest of the developing world-it does not appear to have been coupled with an improvement in economic wealth in this region of the world; see Fay and Opal [11] and World Bank [36]. 1  Furthermore, it is now a well known fact that internal migration has been a major factor fueling the growth of Africa's cities. For example, it has been estimated that rural-urban migration has accounted for roughly half of urban growth in Africa between the 1960s and 1990s (Zachariah and Conde [37], Kelley [18]), with large variations across countries. These evolutions and further predicted increases in urbanization have consequently raised concerns about the capacity of Africa's urban system to absorb such massive movements of population and its impact on sustainable development.\\nA natural starting point in trying to understand the lack of connection between urbanization and development in sub-Saharan Africa is to analyze the potential determinants of urbanization on this continent. From the general literature on what causes urbanization, one can essentially distinguish between two groups of explanations of rural-urban movements, which we loosely label as demand pull and supply push type. With regard to the former, it is generally assumed that modern sectors of production, which generally locate in urban areas, have higher rates of productivity and monetary reward than the traditional rural agricultural sector and hence attract urban-rural migrants. As highlighted in the seminal work by Harris and Todaro [14], this may happen despite persistent unemployment in urban areas since potential migrants base their decision on their expected income. Thus, urbanization in developing countries may result from the existence of a market failure, leading to the so-called over-urbanization thesis; see, amongst others, Gugler [13]. More recently, by adding rural-urban migration to a standard monocentric city model, Brueckner [7] points as well to the importance of the income gap between urban and rural areas as a determinant of urbanization in developing countries. Apart from the general urbanization issue, several studies have also focused in particular on explaining the spectacular and arguably unsustainable growth of mega cities, i.e., urban concentration. Using a sample of developed and developing countries, Ades and Glaeser [1] show, for instance, that rent-seeking activities have been paramount in explaining the rise of such mega-cities, while Davis and Henderson's [8] results on panel data support these findings, highlighting more generally the importance of political factors in explaining the growth of mega cities.\\nSupply-push explanations, in contrast, essentially refer to the possibility that other factors directly affecting the rural sector have favored population movements towards cities but may not necessarily result in productivity improvements. These may include displacement of population due to civil conflicts or other more direct determinants of agricultural production. As such, rural to urban migration can be seen as a survival strategy, affecting especially the poorest segment of the rural population. 2 One particular supply-push type factor that may have been important in determining urbanization in Africa, and that is the focus of the current paper, is that of climate change. In particular, long-run climate change scenarios tend to suggest that extreme climate variations and, more specifically, water shortages, are likely to cause abrupt changes in human settlements and urbanization patterns in sub-Saharan Africa more than anywhere else in 1 Moreover, according to UN [32] projections, sub-Saharan Africa's urbanization should further increase by about 3.5 percent annually in the next 30 years. 2 Educational levels seem to play little role in determining migration in many developing countries, as indicated by the fact that many migrants work in low skilled informal sector jobs, such as street vending, see Todaro [31].\\nthe world; see Watson et al. [34]. It has also relatively recently been noted that rainfall in Africa has, in general, been on a decline since its relative peak in the 1960s; see, for instance, Nicholson [27,28]. The specific effects of climate change on rural-urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa have, however, as of date been poorly documented. A particularly important starting-point is that sub-Saharan African agriculture is especially dependent on rainfall compared to most other developing countries, which triggers the potential impact of rainfall variations on economic activity; see Barrios et al. [2]. These impacts are, in turn, especially pronounced in rural areas where agriculture concentrates, and thus potentially affect rural-urban migration patterns. In this regard, one should note that, although climate per se is seldom the direct root of migration, except in extreme cases like floods or droughts, it clearly can, however, exacerbate difficult living conditions at the margin of subsistence.\\nThe current paper provides empirical evidence showing that climatic change has been an important determinant of rural-urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa. More generally, our focus is linked to the concept of eco-refugees or environmental refugees, where environmental conditions may influence socio-economic conditions and hence migration (Myers [26]). 3,4 We specifically set out to investigate the role of the general decline in rainfall on the African continent since the 1960s in shaping its urbanization patterns. In this regard we take advantage of a new comprehensive cross-country data set on rainfall and commonly used United Nations data on urbanization. Placing these in an econometric specification of the determinants of urbanization we then explicitly test for the impact of rainfall on urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa using other developing countries as a natural control group. Our results show that rainfall has indeed been an important determinant of urbanization growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, we find that this effect was much stronger after decolonization when there were less restrictions on migration in most countries.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline a simple theoretical factor specific framework to demonstrate how rainfall may affect urbanization patterns. In Section 3, we discuss Africa's rural sector vulnerability to shortages in rainfall. Section 4 describes our data and provides summary statistics. Our econometric framework and estimation results are presented in Section 5. Concluding remarks are provided in the final section.\",\n",
       "  'The link between rural-urban migration and rainfall: a specific factors framework': 'The specific factors model (Jones [17]) is a particularly useful theoretical framework in order to conceptualize the link between rural-urban migration and changes in rainfall. Here we use a slightly modified version of this model in order to consider the effect of variations in rainfall in the agriculture sector. Accordingly, suppose we have an economy that has two industries, the rural/agricultural sector (A) and the urban/manufacturing sector (M), and three factors of production, \"effective\" land input (L), labor (N ), and capital (K). Here, land is specific to the agricultural sector whereas capital is specific to the manufacturing sector, and labor is supposed to be freely mobile between the two sectors. Thus, the production function in the rural/agricultural and the urban/manufacturing sectors are\\nY A = L (R) 1-α A N α A A ,(1)\\nY M = K 1-α M N α M M (2)\\nwhere K stands for capital endowment of the economy and α A (α M ) is the elasticity of agricultural (manufacturing) output with respect to labor. Unlike the standard specific factors model, we assume that the effective land input depends on the level of rainfall (R), that is, L(R). In order to see the positive impact of rainfall on the effective land input, we assume L (R) > 0. We also assume that the economy is small in the sense that prices of the two sectors, pA and pM , are exogenously given.\\nFor simplicity we postulate that both the agricultural and the manufacturing sectors exhibit constant returns to scale technologies. In this case, first order conditions lead to the following results:\\npA ∂Y A ∂N A = w ⇒ N A = α 1 1-α A A w pA - 1 1-α A L(R), (3\\n)\\npM ∂Y M ∂N M = w ⇒ N M = α 1 1-α M M w pM - 1 1-α M K, (4\\n)\\nwhere N A /N M is the mass of workers in the agricultural/manufacturing sector. From Eqs. ( 3) and ( 4) and the labor market equilibrium condition, N A + N M = N , we have the equilibrium wage rate and the equilibrium distribution of workers between the two sectors {w * , N * A , N * M }, as functions of the parameters {L(R), K, pA , pM }. The equilibrium urbanization rate is given by U ≡ N * M / N . In order to analyze the impact of rainfall on urbanization, we first have to determine the rate of changes in agricultural and manufacturing employment\\ndN A N A = RL (R) L(R) η L(R) dR R - 1 1 -α A dw w , (5\\n)\\ndN M N M = - 1 1 -α M dw w . (6\\n)\\nTaking the rate of change in the labor market equilibrium condition, we have\\n(1 -U) dN A N A + U dN M N M = 0,(7)\\nwhere we abstract from the growth in the labor force. From Eqs. ( 5), (6), and ( 7), we derive the following proposition.',\n",
       "  'Proposition. A decline in rainfall raises the urbanization rate. Specifically, the elasticity of the urbanization rate with respect to rainfall is given by': '∂ ln U ∂ ln R = ∂ ln N M ∂ ln R = - η L(R) U 1-U + 1-α M 1-α A < 0. (8\\n)\\nThe impact of a change in rainfall can in fact be assimilated to the change in factor endowment à la Rybczynski showing how changes in an endowment affect sectoral outputs. Here a similar effect can help to better understand the linkages between changes in productivity of the input specific to agriculture (i.e. land) through changes in rainfall and changes in the urbanization rate through change in the relative share of manufacturing versus agriculture employment. 5',\n",
       "  'The rainfall dependence of sub-Saharan African agriculture': \"The dependence of sub-Saharan African (henceforth SSA) agriculture on rainfall and its implications for Africa's economic development has been widely documented in the literature. The present section summarizes this literature and more extended discussion can be found, for instance in Barrios et al. [2] and IPCC [15]. Changes in rainfall can potentially have a wide array of economic implications anywhere in the developing world given that rainfall is the main driver of water balance variability both over space and time. Historically, however, shortages in rainfall in Africa seem to have been associated with particularly damaging consequences, in the most extreme cases causing food and water deficiencies and the death and displacement of substantial shares of population. Part of the reason of why shortages in rainfall have been important for Africa is certainly due to the importance of the agricultural sector in its economies. Table 1 shows, for example, that agriculture has traditionally had a higher share in GDP in Africa than in any other developing regions-nearly 40 percent in 1960. Although this share has since been steadily decreasing, it still represents almost a third of total GDP in 1997, compared to the average 14.1 per cent in the rest of the developing world. In particular, African agriculture relies heavily on rainfall for the provision of water for crops. Indeed, compared to other developing areas in the world, a much smaller proportion of cropland is irrigated. More generally speaking, the geographic and climatic conditions specific to the African continent explain to a great extent why agriculture in SSA is so vulnerable to water shortages.\\nGenerally speaking, agriculture in the African tropical area is seriously hampered by high temperature, fragile soils, and low yield potential. It also suffers from chronic diseases affecting both animal and non-animal production. Outside its equatorial area, a large share of Africa's arable land suffers from aridity, tending to increase the risk of drought as drier soil absorbs more rainfall; see Bloom and Sachs [6]. 6 The vulnerability to rainfall in the arid and semiarid areas of the continent also translates into a poor capacity of most African soils to retain moisture. Furthermore, evapotranspiration is in turn relatively high in Africa, as a consequence of high temperature throughout the year, thus leaving low quantities of water for soil moisture. 7 The reduction of vegetative cover experienced by Africa over the past decades has also added to the insufficient inter-annual soil water storage; see UNEP [33]. Land-surface and atmosphere conditions may thus interact positively as a feedback mechanism leading to a further decrease in precipitation.\\nAgricultural practices often add to the water shortage problem in Africa more than anywhere else due to differences in property rights. More precisely, because farmers are often not owners of the land they work on, the preservation of natural resources is often viewed as a secondary objective. In addition, pressures represented by increasing populations and changing technology add to the problem of land deterioration related to agricultural practices; see, for example, Drechsel et al. [9]. Problems associated with land use through, for example, deforestation, can translate into increased erosion. Another illustration of environment-damaging agricultural practices is the intense use of fertilizer in low-quality lands. As yields increase, so will water consumption, thus creating a vicious cycle; see Gommes and Petrassi [12]. This causes greater exposure to desertification with the shortages in rainfall directly influencing agricultural productivity. Human practices can also add to the desertification risks through overgrazing, which is represented by higher density and/or shorter rotations of livestock beyond the limit of the ecosystem, in particular because range-fed livestock are usually concentrated in the arid and semi-arid areas since tropical areas provide potentially more exposure to animal diseases; see IPCC [15].\\nThis high vulnerability of agriculture on climatic conditions in turn opens the door to the possibility of large-scale migrations of those whose livelihood essentially depends on rain-fed agriculture, the so-called environmental migrants that have partly converged to cities. As a matter of fact, in SSA countries, urban growth has essentially been achieved through in-migration of agricultural populations, where nearly half of Africa's urbanization in the last decades has been achieved by rural-urban migration, although there have been large variations across countries (Kelley [18]).\",\n",
       "  'Data and summary statistics': 'As is standard in recent studies of urbanization and urban concentration, the data set underlying our econometric analysis consists of five-year interval observations to avoid issues related to temporal dependence. Given the missing values for some countries and some time periods, the nature of our data consists of an unbalanced panel, covering 78 countries and spanning over a 30-year period (1960-1990).',\n",
       "  'Rainfall data': 'The basic hypothesis of the paper poses that climatic conditions push people out of rural/agricultural areas to urban areas. 8 Our measure of climatic condition will be the rainfall level in a country and is taken from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data set, which provides, amongst other things, time series data on the average annual rainfall for 289 \"countries\" (comprised of 188 states and 101 islands and territories) from 1901 to 1998; see Mitchell et al. [24] for a complete description of the data set. These rainfall series were constructed by assimilating measurements of rainfall from meteorological stations across the world into 0.5 degree latitude by 0.5 degree longitude grids covering the land surface of the earth. Each grid-box was then assigned to the appropriate country in order to calculate a measure of rainfall for each by using the weighted mean of the values of all grid boxes within a country. 9 This procedure resulted in comparable mean measures, given in millimeters per square meters, of annual rainfall for each country. For the purposes of this paper we use observations on developing countries, where we consider a country to be of developing status if it is either a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income nation according to the World Bank 2001 definition. All countries used in any part of our empirical analysis are listed in Appendix Table A.\\nThere are a number of issues to be noted in terms of constructing and using the cross-country measure of annual rainfall. First, we chose to normalize the rainfall measure provided in the data set by the long-term mean annual rainfall in each country. This was primarily done because we are interested in climatic changes, rather than permanent cross-country climatic differences in levels. In order to avoid any concerns regarding the exogeneity of this normalization factor we used the mean of the annual rainfall for the period prior to 1960, although using the long-term mean over the entire available period produced very similar results. 10 One should note that a similar measure is also used by the FAO; see Gommes and Petrassi [12]. Since our econometric analysis focuses on the effect of rainfall on long-term, five-year, intervals, we calculated the simple arithmetic mean of the annual normalized rainfall measure over the appropriate five-year intervals.\\nOne other aspect with regard to our rainfall measure that deserves discussion, because it has plagued many studies examining other potential determinants of Africa\\'s poor growth performance, is the question of its exogeneity. In terms of rainfall we can argue fairly confidently that it is a strictly exogenous factor given that it measures an aspect of climatic change. While one could in theory also hypothesize that perhaps economic activity affects such aspects as environmental degradation and desertification, and thereby possibly rainfall, Nicholson [27] finds no evidence suggesting such. As a matter of fact, earlier historical data suggests that rainfall naturally moves through long cycles of relative troughs and peaks, and that a cycle similar to the present one seems to have occurred in the 19th century; see Nicholson [28].\\nFinally, one should note that our measure of rainfall only offers a countrywide measure of precipitation. Clearly, however, particularly in large countries there may be considerable variation even within national boundaries and constraints on growth may thus be due to logistical problems of redistribution. Given the lack of data, we unfortunately have to abstract from any intra-country climatic variation. Having said this, one must remark that first this problem is partly tackled by using a fixed effect estimator, purging out time invariant unobservable covariates, which is likely to be a characteristic common to measurement errors in rainfall. 11 Furthermore, issues related to the aggregation of variables at the macro level are inherent of all cross-country empirical analysis.\\nFigure 1 depicts the long-term trends in our normalized rainfall measure for SSA countries. As can be seen, while variable, the mean rainfall in SSA countries remained roughly constant during the first part of the 20th century until the 1950s, peaking in the late 1950s. However, 9 Where a grid box was located across more than one country, the grid box was assigned to the country with the largest stake, except where a country would otherwise have been left without any grid box. Weighting was essential since the spatial areas represented by each grid box differ in latitude. For further details; see Mitchell et al. [24]. 10 Details are available from the authors. 11 In a recent study, Miguel et al. [22] similarly use a country-level rainfall-variation measure in order to instrument growth in African countries.  since this peak, rainfall has been on a clear downward trend. As a matter of fact, apart from a peak in 1980, mean rainfall has been for the most part lower than during the first 60 years of the century. These trends suggest that there has been an important climatic change in SSA since about roughly the late 1970s. Figure 2 shows, in contrast, that average annual rainfall in nonsub-Saharan developing countries displays no such trend.',\n",
       "  'Urbanization': \"Our source to construct the urbanization data stems from the UN World Urbanization Prospects [32], where urbanization is defined as the share of population living in cities to total population living in the country, and for which information is given over 5-year periods. Definitions of urbanization are those used by national statistics offices based on their latest census data. Thus, different countries having different definitions of cities, our measure of urbanization is not consistent across countries. 12 One has, however, to note that data from the World Urbanization Prospects is adjusted, whenever possible, when there are definitional changes between two censuses in a country. Consequently, one can confidently consider that definitional differences of urbanization across countries are time invariant, and thus absorbed by the fixed effect.\\nFigures from the UN World Urbanization Prospects reveal that urbanization growth rates in SSA countries have been steadily above those of the rest of the developing world over the past half century. For example, in 2000 Africa's share of urban to total population reached 37 percent (UN [32]), driven by an average annual growth rate of the urban population share of 4.4 percent between 1950 to 2000. In comparison the rest of the developing world experienced average annual growth rates of urbanization in the order of only 2.5 percent over the same period.\",\n",
       "  'Other data': \"In terms of controlling for other potential determinants of urbanization in our econometric modeling we chose a set of covariates that are standard in the literature studying the determinants of urbanization (Ades and Glaeser [1], Brueckner [7], Davis and Henderson [8], Gugler [13], among others). First, we use the size of a country's population and this measure interacted with land area since for a given population, a larger land area reduces population density, and thus influences transport within the country, which in turn might impact on urbanization through standard forward/backward linkages (Krugman and Livas Elizondo [19]). Information measuring these two variables is derived from the Penn World Tables (PWT) and the World Development Indicators (WDI), respectively. It has also been argued that openness to international markets is intrinsically linked to urbanization as countries with higher shares of trade in GDP rarely have their population concentrated in a single city. The rationale for this is that, given imported goods are not cheaper in large cities, consumers spread over space to save on congestion costs (Ades and Glaeser [1]). We thus also control for openness using the measure contained in the PWT.\\nIn the endogenous growth literature, a close connection between urbanization and national economic growth has been recognized; see, for instance, Lucas [20]. Although the causality has been subject of intense debates, it is a well-admitted fact that sustained economic growth has always been accompanied by urbanization. In their panel data study, McCoskey and Kao [21] have for instance shown that a long run relationship between urbanization, output per worker and capital per worker cannot be rejected on a sample of 30 developing countries. We thus add a measure of GDP/capita as a control regressor in our specification.\\nMore recently, it has also been shown that civil wars within a country and bordering countries can influence differences in rates of economic development across countries (Murdoch and Sandler [25]), and that during periods of armed conflicts one can usually observe increases in urban immigration because people often seek safety and try to escape famines in well-supplied urban areas (Berhanu and White [5]). As a proxy for this we use the civil war variable constructed by Murdoch and Sandler [25], which is measured as the number of years of civil wars in a country. Furthermore, Barro [3] has shown that there is a negative link between urbanization and democracy. Non-democratic institutions may disfavor urbanization on the ground that cities make it easier for people to meet and communicate. As Weber [35] already noted, city air makes one free. Conversely, assembling people makes it easier for an autocrat to monitor and control the people, and as a corollary, more democratic institutions would then facilitate displacement of people through migrations, among others rural-urban migrations. To account for this, we use the democracy variable from the POLITY database, which ranges from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and measures general openness of political institutions.\\nFinally, during periods of colonization there notably were restrictions on intra-national movements of population, especially for African natives, in certain regions of Africa. Thus, in order to take account of this we use a decolonization indicator variable, equal to 0 when countries were colonized and 1 otherwise. The information on the date of decolonization has been taken from the CIA factbook. 13   \",\n",
       "  'Summary statistics': 'Using available data on rainfall and the other control variables listed above left us with a sample of 78 developing countries, of which 36 are SSA and the remainder are nonsub-Saharan African (henceforth NSSA), for five-year periods over the years . One should note that because even within this common time period of all our main variables used in our analysis there was not data available for all countries in any given five year segment and hence that our panel data set is of an unbalanced nature.\\nSummary statistics of all our explanatory variables across the two groups are given in Table 2. Accordingly, one finds, as would be expected, that urbanization is lower in SSA than elsewhere. One should also note that normalized rainfall is lower, compared to rainfall figures in NSSA nations. In terms of the other variables, one discovers that SSA countries are poorer, but have greater openness. Also, while they are less democratic, they have nevertheless experienced less civil wars. Moreover, the summary statistics on population size and land area suggest that African countries are much less populated and have lower population densities on average. Finally, during our sample period there were more periods of colonization in SSA than in NSSA countries.  13 For details: see: http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/.',\n",
       "  'Econometric results': \"In order to validate the basic hypothesis of the paper, we run parametric estimations examining the determinants, including climatic change, of urbanization. In particular, we estimate\\nU it = α + βX it + δR it + λ t + μ i + ε it , (9\\n)\\nwhere U is the log of urbanization rate, defined as the share of urban to total population, R is our primary explanatory variable, i.e., log of rainfall, X is a vector of other time varying potential determinants, λ are year specific effects common to all countries, μ are time invariant country specific effects possibly correlated with other explanatory variables, and ε is the usual error term.\\nIn order to purge the effects of μ, i.e., all time invariant determinants, from (9) we, as is common in cross-country studies with time dimension, use a fixed effects estimator.\\nOur results of estimating ( 9), first without including our proxy for climatic change, are shown in the first column of Table 3. As can be seen, only openness and democracy play significant roles in determining the rate of urbanization. In this regard, one should note that openness is in line with a priori expectation, i.e., economies that are more open also have higher rates of urbanization, while democracy encourages lower urbanization. In the second column of the same table we subsequently included our measure of climatic change, i.e., rainfall. The negative and highly significant coefficient on this proxy provides strong support for our main hypothesis embodied in (9), where, accordingly, decreases in rainfall encourage migration to urban areas. The size of the coefficient suggests that a one-percent fall in normalized precipitation induces urbanization to rise by 0.45 percent.\\nIn order to investigate whether the negative relationship between urbanization and rainfall is different across SSA and NSSA nations as we argued in Section 3, we interacted our rainfall measure with a SSA dummy, as shown in the third column of Table 3, thus using the NSSA countries as a control group. The fact that this renders rainfall on its own insignificant, but produces a negative and significant coefficient on the interaction terms, suggests that on average there has only been an effect of rainfall on urbanization in SSA countries. This result can be explained, as suggested in Section 3, by the very different geographic, cultural features and also agriculture practices specific to SSA. One may also want to note that the coefficient on the interaction term is substantially larger than that found on rainfall on its own in the specification without the interaction term. As a robustness check we also separated out our total sample into SSA and NSSA sub-samples and reran (9) for these separately, results of which can be found in the fourth (SSA sample) and fifth (NSSA sample) columns of Table 3. Importantly, this allows both coefficients and the error generating process to be different across these country groups. As can be seen, this qualitatively confirms our results for the pooled sample-rainfall only has a significant effect for the SSA group although one may want to view the results with some caution since, particularly for SSA, it restricts sample size considerably.\\nOne potentially important aspect neglected thus far is that, during colonial times, native Africans were often forbidden to live permanently in cities of eastern and southern Africa (O'Connor [29]). More precisely, during the colonial period, certain laws kept most Africans from residing in the white European cities in many areas of Africa. Partly as a consequence of this, in the 1950s, Africa was the least urbanized region of the world, with roughly 15 percent of its inhabitants living in urban centers, compared to figures above 30 per cent in the rest of the developing world and around 60 percent in the developed countries. These strict prohibitions disappeared after independence except in South Africa. 14 Thus, when the African colonies obtained their independence, migration to cities increased sharply, changing the racial composition of cities and leading to rapidly mounting urban populations. Following a catch up movement, urbanization accelerated rapidly after independence with mass movement of population away from the rapidly deteriorating agricultural sector and the fall in world raw commodity prices in the early 1980s (Miller and Singh [23]). 14 The case of South Africa is of particular interest. It gained its independence in 1910, but segregation laws continued to persist, especially after the adoption of the policy of apartheid in 1948. During the 19th century, separate villages for African and colored people were established in the smaller towns. Official segregative tendencies were given a boost by the outbreak of bubonic plague in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth in 1901, with the establishment of new state-controlled African locations several kilometers from the centers of the two cities (Swanson [30]). This in turn drastically limited the pace of urbanization in South Africa.\\nGiven that part of the time series used here captures times of decolonization, particularly in SSA, we have further investigated the possibility that rainfall's impact on urbanization in SSA countries may have changed for some countries in our estimations. In order to do so, we have interacted a decolonization dummy jointly with the SSA dummy and the rainfall variable in the last column of Table 3. Moreover, in order to ensure that we are not just capturing other factors that altered with colonial independence, we also appropriately included the dummy on its own, its interaction with rainfall, and its interaction with the SSA dummy. Firstly, the coefficient of the interaction term with the SSA dummy suggests that urbanization in SSA increased significantly after countries became independent as one would naturally expect following the discussion above. More importantly, however, while the coefficient on the interaction term between the SSA dummy and rainfall remains negative and statistically highly significant, the coefficient on the interaction term of the decolonization dummy, the SSA dummy, and rainfall also displays a statistically significant negative coefficient. This implies that in times of independence, rainfall has had a reinforced impact on internal migration towards cities. This result, in turn, is consistent with the argument according to which decolonization has allowed greater internal movement of individuals, in response to climatic conditions.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'In this paper we have examined whether climatic change in terms of decreasing trends in rainfall may provide some explanation towards the very different urbanization patterns that have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other developing countries over the last several decades. Our analysis suggests that indeed this has been the case. Specifically, we find that while shortages in rainfall have acted to increase rates of urbanization on the sub-Saharan African continent, there is no evidence of such for the rest of the developing world. Moreover, our analysis suggests that this link was reinforced after colonial independence of sub-Saharan African countries, which often resulted in the simultaneous lifting of legislation prohibiting the free internal movement of native Africans.'},\n",
       " 5: {'abstract': \"This paper examines the role of environmental change as a driver of migration, a central concern of areas of inquiry ranging from the Human Dimensions of Global Change research to population geography and development studies. Although much of the literature on the role of the environment in migration reflects a general awareness that environmental factors are but one of a suite of influences shaping migration decisionmaking, a framework within which to place social, economic, and environmental issues with regard to particular migration decisions is absent from this literature. Drawing upon recent contributions to the literature on migration, and political ecological concerns for access to and control over resources, in this paper I present a framework for placing such issues founded on a Foucauldian conceptualization of power. This framework treats environment, economy, and society as both products of and productive of social differentiation, instrumental modes of power, and resistance. These forms shape actors' understanding and negotiation of their social, economic, and environmental contexts, and therefore their migration decisionmaking. I illustrate the application of this framework through the example of three villages in Ghana's Central Region, where rural environmental and economic changes appear to have driven a complex pattern of outmigration over the past thirty-five years. This migration shows the ways in which environmental change becomes inseparable from local perceptions of economy and local politics through local manifestations of power.\",\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"The link between environmental change and migration is of critical interest not only to demographers and economic planners, but also to those who seek to understand the human dimensions of global change and devise means of mitigating the human impacts of these changes. The commonly held belief that the developing world will bear the brunt of global environmental change in the immediate future (see, for example, World Bank Institute, 2003) makes the understanding of such links of great importance to development as well.\\nAlthough the literature on environmental migration, environmental migrants, and environmental refugees reflects a general awareness that it is rarely productive to separate environmental drivers from economic and political concerns when examining many `environmentally motivated' migrations (for example, Bates, 2002;McGregor, 1993), there is no discussion in this literature of how environment, economy, and politics are linked in such migration decisions. In the (case-study-driven) literature attempts have been made to foreground the role of the environment in migration (attempts that are part of a larger, important project seeking to inject environmental change into broader discussions on migration and refugees) and many studies create caricatures of migration decisionmaking that are easily discredited, in effect discounting the important role the environment does play in migration decisionmaking.\\nIn this paper I present a framework within which we can link environment, economy, and society to understand better migration decisionmaking and therefore the role of the environment in such decisions. Building upon an awareness of the importance of social structure in environmental and migration decisionmaking in both contemporary migration studies (for example, Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003;Silvey and Lawson, 1999) and political ecological explorations of politics, economy, and environment (for example, Carney, 1988;1992;1996;Carney and Watts, 1990;Kull, 2002;Peet and Watts, 1996;Peluso and Watts, 2001;Pred and Watts, 1992;Robbins, 1998;Rocheleau et al, 1996;Schroeder, 1997;Schroeder and Suryanata, 1996), I argue in this paper that environment, economy, and society are linked in migration decisionmaking through local manifestations of power. These manifestations of power are the condition for and result of local understandings of environment, economy, and society for migrants and therefore form the foundation upon which the rationale for migration decisions takes shape.\\nI begin with a brief overview of the literature on environmental change as a driver of migration, examining the dominant assumptions within this literature and some of the critical voices that have emerged to challenge these assumptions. I then turn to the convergence of contemporary approaches to migration decisionmaking and political ecological studies of access to and control over resources. This convergence centers on a shared understanding of the importance of local social relations in both migration decisionmaking and resource access. By using this convergence as a foundation upon which to build connections between migration and economic, environmental, and social change, I present a framework within which one can explore a particular migration decision as shaped by local manifestations of power. I then illustrate the effectiveness of this framework through a case study of three villages in Ghana's Central Region which experienced various effects of an out-migration between 1970 and 1995. Environmental change played an important role in this migration, but it is not a sufficient explanatory factor for migrant decisionmaking when the complexity of this migration is fully engaged. To discount the role of environmental change in favor of economic or political concerns, however, is also to misrepresent the processes at work in this context. The complex migration response to these changes, when explored via the changing manifestation of power in this context, links environment, economy, and politics into a richer understanding of migration decisionmaking than is available through current explanatory models in the environmental migration literature.\",\n",
       "  'Migration and the environment': 'Current studies of the relationship between environment and migration generally fail to reference contemporary works not only in the broader field of migration studies, but also in related nature ^society studies that examine uneven access to and control over resources. I therefore begin by discussing the current approaches to understanding the role of the environment in migration. I follow this with an examination of contemporary approaches to migration and political ecology to highlight the ways these two areas of thought share a focus on the importance of social relations in shaping local decisionmaking. It is this shared focus on social relations that provides the foundation for the migration framework of this paper.',\n",
       "  'Environmental causes of migration': \"Much of the literature on the environmental causes of migration (and on environmental refugees) rests on what Suhrke (1994) calls a maximalist point of view, in which the environment is the primary, if not only, cause of migration. In this view, environmental degradation is a cause of insecurity. This insecurity `displaces' people insofar as it causes them to seek out settings of greater safety and certainty (Kibreab, 1997, page 20;O'Lear, 1997, page 612).\\nMaximalist writing has been heavily critiqued within the migration literature on two major fronts. First, a number of writers (Bates, 2002, page 466;Hugo, 1996, page 106;Lonergan 1998;Suhrke, 1994) note that not all migrations relate to environmental change in the same manner. There are clear differences, for example, between those migrants fleeing a volcanic eruption and those who leave because of gradual soil degradation. In cases of gradual environmental change, actors weighing the decision to move appear to integrate environmental change with other issues, such as their economic and political situation. Because this particular debate on the relationship between environmental change and migration is generally framed around the issue of refugees, it is preoccupied with identifying what kinds of environmental change clearly constitute a ``legitimate'' push for migration (see also Myers, 2002;Myers and Kent, 1995). Therefore, although this literature raises important questions about the role of the environment as a driver of migration, this debate does not closely interrogate the links between environment, economy, and politics in migration decisionmaking.\\nThe issue of links between migration, environment, economy, and politics in particular migration decisions is taken up in a second, `minimalist' (Suhrke, 1994), approach to migration. Supporters of this minimalist approach argue that it makes little sense to separate the political and the economic from the environmental (for example Bates, 2002;Lonergan, 1998;McGregor, 1993). Very little of this work, however, actually engages how the environment, as one of a suite of drivers in a specific context, becomes integrated with economic and political concerns. Instead, this literature tends to focus on case studies that illustrate the shared importance of economy, politics, and environment in a given migration decision.\",\n",
       "  'Migration, migrants, and the environment: local decisionmaking in contemporary frameworks': \"A number of authors have recently published reviews of the migration literature couched in the context of rethinking that literature's approach to the migrant and to migration (see Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003;Lawson, 1998;Lonergan, 1998;Silvey and Lawson, 1999). Rather than reexamine this literature, I present the broad characterizations in these reviews to situate the contemporary approaches that I will draw upon later in this paper. These reviews divide the migration literature into two camps. The first of these camps is referred to as neoclassical (Lawson, 1998;Lonergan, 1998;Silvey and Lawson, 1999) or rational choice (Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003). According to this line of inquiry, people migrate because they expect a greater net return (usually measured in money) on that migration than from staying in place. Although migrations rarely reflect the uniformity one might expect from such economizing rationality, adherents to this school of explanation argue that variation in decisionmaking is the product of actors dealing with such issues as imperfect information, imperfect competition, and bounded rationality (Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003, page 188). Although this school of thought grants actors agency in their migration decisions, as Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan (2003, page 189) point out, this agency is ``a curiously deterministic version ... governed by the imperatives of utility optimization.''\\nThe second line of inquiry in migration studies which can be identified in reviews of the migration literature is a political economy (Lawson, 1998;Lonergan, 1998) or Marxist (Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003) perspective. This approach treats migration as a structural response to a change in political economy. Specifically, proponents of this approach see migration as a response to uneven development and the ongoing efforts of the powerful in society to exploit the less powerful. Consequently, a study informed by this perspective does not explain a migration of rural agriculturalists moving to cities to take up factory labor through individual agency. Instead, this migration is treated as part of a broader political economy in which the recruitment of these seasonal laborers is a tactic by which the politically and economically powerful create surplus labor pools to keep wages low and maximize profits. These political economy models, then, tend to deny the agency of individuals in their analyses, suggesting instead that the political economic structure determines behavior (Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003, page 188;Lawson, 1998, page 41;Silvey and Lawson, 1999, page 126).\\nAlthough there exist extensive debates between the neoclassical and political economy approaches within the migration literature, a number of authors have pointed out their shared shortcomings. Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan (2003, page 189) offer the broadest critique of both schools, arguing that neither offers any interrogation of a modernist rationality that reduces the migrant and migration to a ``necessary, if sometimes unfortunate, subplot in the unfolding of history'' (see also Silvey and Lawson, 1999, page 126). This broad critique is echoed in the work of other critics (see Halfacree and Boyle, 1993, pages 334 ^335;McHugh, 2000, page 74), who argue that both camps reduce migrants to automatons acting out a stimulus ^response cycle.\\nThe problems that rational choice and political economy approaches to migration share have prompted a number of critics to offer their own alternatives to these dominant schools. Many of these critics aim to understand ``how migrants apprehend, negotiate, and transform the social structures that impinge on their lives'' (Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003, page 190; see also Halfacree and Boyle, 1993). The diverse approaches that result from their critiques range from efforts to explore the transformative power of consumption (for example, Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan, 2003), to the exploration of the voices of migrants (for example, Silvey and Lawson, 1999) and their biographies (for example, Halfacree and Boyle, 1993;Lawson, 2000), to a heightened engagement with feminist theory (for example, Lawson, 1998).\\nThese alternative migration approaches parallel work in political ecology, especially feminist political ecology, that focuses on uneven access to and control over resources. Feminist political ecology extends the explanation of this uneven access, often linked to the social cleavages of class and ethnicity, to the critical cleavage of gender [for example, the contributors to Rocheleau et al (1996), and less explicitly Carney (1992;1996), Carney and Watts (1990), Schroeder (1997), andSchroeder andSuryanata (1996)]. Such work focuses on the ways in which local social relations form crucial bridges between changing local understandings of the environment and resources, flows of transnational capital, and changes in government policy. In this way, we can treat this literature [which is itself drawn from an extensive literature on household economic and social relations, such as Barrett et al (2001), Goheen (1988), Haller (2000), Kalinda et al (2000), Low (1989), Reardon (1997), andWilk (1997)] as a minimalist political economy approach similar to minimalist approaches to migration. Just as a minimalist approach to migration notes that environmental change is rarely enough to explain migration decisions, so feminist political ecology recognizes that capital and governmental policy, although very important, are not sufficient to determine changes in resource use. In both frameworks an understanding of the local social structure is critical to an understanding of any such changes.\\nThe convergence of the contemporary migration literature with the interests of political ecology is based on a shared understanding of the importance of local social relations in human perception and decisionmaking. These social relations, therefore, serve as a point of contact between the migration literature, which attempts to understand migrant subjectivity, and the political ecological literature, which attempts to understand the social construction of resources and their use. This point of contact creates the potential for a link between environmental change and migrant subjectivities.\",\n",
       "  'Environmental change and migration: a contemporary approach': \"To generate a framework we can use to explore and understand the relationship between environmental change and migration decisionmaking, we must make explicit the connection between the political ecological attention to the social construction of the environment and the contemporary migration literature's minimalist focus on migrant subjectivities as a driver of migration. In short, we need to theorize explicitly how people apprehend, negotiate, and transform their local context in a manner that links environment to migration. The framework I propose here employs a Foucauldian conceptualization of power (specifically drawn from his 1994 piece ``The subject and power'') and its circulation through society as a central way to theorize this apprehension, negotiation, and transformation. I turn to this particular piece because it is one of the few in which Foucault tries to bridge a poststructural conceptualization of power and an understanding of how that power affects society, agency, and action. This effort is perhaps best captured in his assertion that power is best understood not as something to be possessed and wielded against another, but rather as ``a way in which certain actions may structure the field of other possible actions'' (Foucault, 1994, page 343). The structure Foucault refers to in this phrase is not that associated with Marxist or Sauerian cultural geographers. Instead, it is an open structure much like the systems of representation described by Rose (2002, page 462) in that it comes ``to exist not through the effects of a preestablished systematizing force (a hegemonic ideology or a dominant discourse) but through the active process of being given form.'' Therefore, the categories and relationships that mark any structure are ``always taking shape as they are expressed differently through different practices'' (Rose, 2002, page 462). The importance of practice in the effort to bridge structure and the poststructural requires an emphasis on the examination of social relations because ``this possibility of action on the action of others ... is coextensive with every social relationship'' (Foucault, 1994, page 345). Specifically, power becomes manifest through ``various kinds of individual disparity, of objectives, of the given application of power over ourselves or others, of more or less partial or universal institutionalization and more or less deliberate organization'' (Foucault, 1994, page 343) seen in every society.\\nCritically, Foucault (1994) observes that power produces new objects of knowledge and information. Particular manifestations of power define what is knowable and what is worth knowing aboutöthey structure the field of possible actions by shaping local understandings of a particular context, the problems that context offers to those living in it, and possible solutions to those problems. The understandings of the world produced by power therefore often induce further relations and effects of power (Foucault, 1994, pages 336 ^339). For example, manifestations of power, shaped as they are by existing social relations, may suggest solutions to problems (`possible actions') that, intentionally or unintentionally, produce or reproduce individual disparities that enable other manifestations of power that further differentiation and inequity in a given context. Foucault called this relationship between the manifestation of power and the creation of understandings of the world power/knowledge, thus highlighting the inseparability of the two.\\nTherefore, a Foucauldian approach to environmental migration builds on the emphasis in both the migration and the political ecology literatures on social structure and differentiation. Such an approach, however, moves beyond the existing literature by shifting the focus of study from conditions that drive migration (which are inevitably accompanied by an implied set of motivations or drivers whose meaning and function are often assumed) toward the local power/knowledge in which environment, ecology, and politics are understood. The ways migrants negotiate and transform their context, and the objectives behind such negotiation and transformation, are the condition and result of this understanding.\\nIt is my contention, then, that, to understand the objectives of particular migration decisions in a given context, one must gain access to the local power/knowledge within which that decision is considered as a possible action. Foucault (1994, page 344) suggests three foci for the analysis of power relationships that facilitate such an investigation. First, we can examine the system of differentiation that is the condition for and result of social relations in the context, for example, by exploring the social categories that define or are defined by economic and political roles. These differentiations are what ``permits one to act upon the actions of others'' (Foucault, 1994, page 344). Second, we must examine the instrumental modes of power employed in that context; that is, the ways in which the system of differentiations is converted from a potential for power into a manifestation of that power. Third (and closely tied to the instrumental modes of power in a given context), we must understand the ways certain actions are rationalized as part of or as productive of a field of possible actions. To this end, forms of resistance, shaped by or shaping a construction of the local context through power/knowledge, will help the researcher identify and define the parameters of local power/knowledge by setting the boundaries of debate. Taken together, and applied to migration decisions, these three foci can help us identify the complex objectives pursued by those who choose to move and those who choose to remain. It is in understanding these objectives that we can place the environment (and economy, society, etc) in migration decisions.\\nTurning now to the case of three villages in Ghana's Central Region, I explore the ways the application of the above-described framework and approach to a local migration event spanning twenty-five years fits into a minimalist view of the role of the environment in this migration. In doing so, this case study illustrates how an understanding of local migration founded on power/knowledge goes beyond the current literatures in migration and political ecology by highlighting how the changing manifestation of power in this context links economy, politics, and environment into a local power/knowledge through which various migration decisions take shape.\",\n",
       "  \"Environment, economy, and the household politics of migration in Ghana's Central Region\": 'The following discussion of the changing situation of Dominase, Ponkrum, and Yesunkwa, three villages in coastal Ghana, is based on fieldwork conducted as part of a larger project assessing local strategies for negotiating economic and environmental change at the rural margins of globalization. This fieldwork spanned 13 months between 1997 and 2000. Beyond the participant observation I conducted while living in and around these villages, in the course of my research I engaged 30 residents of Dominase and Ponkrum (14 men and 16 women) in more than 60 interviews about their household economies and agricultural strategies. I conducted another 30 interviews on these same topics with 14 residents (8 men and 6 women) in Yesunkwa. Though I attempted to obtain a cross section of the population by gender (I targeted members of the same household to observe household dynamics better) and a reasonable distribution of ages, my sample population was fundamentally based on individual willingness to participate in the research.\\nThe interviews, although relatively unstructured, constituted what Rubin and Rubin (1995, page 47) call a continuous design model, focused on understanding the structure of the household economy and agricultural practice in these villages. Under the continuous design model, I followed the answers I received to various questions (and from various sources) to new lines of inquiry, until I reached what Glaser and Strauss (1967, pages 61 ^62, 111 ^112) call theoretical saturation: the point at which new concepts and paths of inquiry ran out and the data gathered through my interviews began to repeat itself. At this point I used surveys, which reached an additional 25 residents (17 men and 8 women) of Dominase and Ponkrum and 25 residents (12 men and 13 women) of Yesunkwa, to flesh out the economic and agricultural trends observed in the interview data at the point of theoretical saturation. The following observations and quotations stem from the interviews, surveys, and participant observation I conducted in these villages. I supplemented this material with archaeological excavation, which I discuss below.',\n",
       "  'Historical context': \"The villages of Dominase and Ponkrum (figure 1, see over) are located at the southern edge of Ghana's Upper Guinea forest, some 8 km northwest of Elmina. They are located a mere 500 m from one another and have, since settlement by Akan farmers in the early 1800s, existed in some configuration of a primary-satellite relationship. Historically, the residents of these villages have farmed plots of land interspersed with one another, such that even today farmers from Dominase pass through Ponkrum to reach their farms, and vice versa. The political structures of these two villages are also closely linked: for example, the current chief of Ponkrum was born in Dominase. These villages are nearly homogeneously Akan, and all residents follow Akan matrilineal kinship and land-tenure practices (discussed below). Therefore, although the residents of these villages might themselves object to this `lumping' on grounds of history or civic pride, to understand the migration dynamics in this area over the past four decades these villages are best considered as a single unit (hereafter referred to as Dominase ^Ponkrum).\\nBy the 1950s the residents of Dominase ^Ponkrum enjoyed relative prosperity among their rural counterparts. A critical component of this prosperity was wage labor from offfarm employment (OFE) opportunities as a result of a local logging operation starting up in the 1940s. This logging operation created various local manual labor jobs. It also improved the roads through these villages, allowing residents access to regional OFE opportunities in nearby towns such as Elmina and Cape Coast. It is important to note that the cash income from these OFE sources accumulated in the hands of men in this area, because the majority of OFE opportunities, whether local or regional, were manual labor, for which men were preferentially selected by prospective employers. While residents who remember logging and the improved roads claim that these wages were an important source of income for local residents, they agree that OFE income only augmented, but never replaced, the food-crop-based household economies of Dominase ^Ponkrum.\\nThe on and off logging to the north of Dominase ^Ponkrum, which continued until the late 1960s, wrought gradual changes on the local environment. These changes, according to current residents of the area, included declining rainfall and increasing soil degradation related to the loss of canopy cover [although there is no meteorological database with a spatial resolution fine enough to support or refute these claims during this time, see Gyesi et al (1995) for a discussion of these issues in another part of Ghana with similar environmental characteristics]. Yet these environmental changes were not sufficient to drive residents from the area. According to current residents of Dominase ^Ponkrum, the OFE and cash cropping income available to households through their male members provided a level of stability and certainty to residents of the area that offset these environmental changes.\\nIt was not until the mid-1960s collapse of world prices for timber (see Huq, 1989) that environmental changes became an issue for residents. This economic change contributed to the demise of the local logging operation (Carr, 2002). Without the other sources of income they had come to rely on as part of the household income, residents began to note the changes twenty years of logging to the north of the area had wrought upon the local environment. Most importantly, residents began to experience difficulties in obtaining crop outputs sufficient to maintain the household income. At this point the residents of Dominase ^Ponkrum began to abandon the area. In the course of mapping Dominase and Ponkrum in 1997, I linked structures (abandoned and occupied) to information gathered through interviews with local residents on the dates of either or both construction and abandonment of particular structures. The resultant village plans (see figure 2) indicated that between 1970 and 1980, some thirty-five households moved out of the area. The vast majority of these households relocated to periurban settlements where they could claim access to land via kinship or personal connection. Yesunkwa, a village located along the principal east ^west highway in Ghana, exemplifies these destination settlements (see figure 1). The move to periurban sites makes sense, given that Yesunkwa's context, like the other periurban destinations, is similar to Dominase ^Ponkrum before the mid-1960s. The residents of Yesunkwa have excellent access both to farmland and to regional OFE opportunities, such as road construction, serving as private watchmen, or working as hall porters at the nearby University of Cape Coast (Carr, 2001). Furthermore, the residents of Yesunkwa and other periurban settlements, unlike those living in contemporary Dominase ^Ponkrum, often have access to electricity and public water. Even today, more than thirty years after the abandonment began, Dominase ^Ponkrum still lacks electricity, public water, public sanitation facilities, and improved transportation connections.\\nThe migration of residents from Dominase ^Ponkrum to periurban settlements, however, is not simply the product of the growing awareness of environmental degradation on the part of the residents via the decline in OFE and cash cropping in this area. Despite the apparent logic of such a move for the many residents of Dominase Ponkrum, the initial migration involved only 33% of the households in these villages. Between 1980 and 1990 another seventeen households (16% of the 1970 total) moved out of Dominase ^Ponkrum, again to periurban settlements. Remarkably, these households were leaving ten years after the conditions apparently motivating this move were in place. Seventeen more households (16% of the 1970 total) moved out in the early 1990s, following the pattern described above. Thus, although some 65% of households located in Dominase and Ponkrum in 1970 eventually migrated in response to a convergence of events and trends that created a push factor for migration from this area, nearly half of the migrating households took more than a decade to respond to this push. This strongly suggests that the connection between economic and environmental change and migration was mitigated in some way in this context. \",\n",
       "  'Social context and migration': \"The previous discussion of push factors, while illustrating the interrelated nature of economic and environmental factors in this migration, does little to explain how these factors are linked in different households to create the migration outcome described above. To explain this linking, I turn to the changing political economy of the household in Dominase ^Ponkrum over the past forty years. In this political economy, it becomes apparent that the system of differentiations was instrumentalized and rationalized in Dominase ^Ponkrum in a way that both privileged men and managed the changing material situation of the residents. I begin with the context of Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment. Building an understanding of the political economy of the household in Dominase ^Ponkrum during this time is considerably more complex than a similar study in the contemporary context. The extremely limited number of original residents remaining in Dominase ^Ponkrum, and the limited number of migrants still living in places such as Yesunkwa, precludes the comparison of household political economies across time within Dominase ^Ponkrum by means of oral historical means alone. This small sample size is problematic because of the limited cross section of the population represented (virtually all remaining original residents are men from a single family). Because migration is a highly political and emotional event, thirty years of hindsight is likely to color residents' memories of their earlier motivations. Further, some of the issues I am exploring are often seen as minor details in the day-to-day lives of those living in these villages. This opens up the possibility of ethnographic presentism, where individuals tend to fill blank spots in their memories with contemporary information, thereby making comparisons between past and present contexts problematic. Therefore, oral historical data on such things as previous agricultural and livelihood practices in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment, while useful in general as a means of framing conditions in the area, cannot be seen as a rigorous source of fine-grained historical data in the absence of other sources of information that might provide some form of a cross-check.\\nTo understand the political economy of households in pre-abandonment Dominase Ponkrum, however, we can compare Dominase ^Ponkrum to contemporary Yesunkwa, the village to which a plurality of the migrants from Dominase ^Ponkrum moved. Such a comparison represents a search for analogies that might prove fruitful for developing an understanding of the changing political economy of the household in Dominase ^Ponkrum over the past four decades. This comparison is not justified through Yesunkwa's role as a destination for Dominase ^Ponkrum's migrants alone. For instance, the economic context of Yesunkwa is very similar to that of Dominase Ponkrum before the abandonment. The location of Yesunkwa along a major east ^west highway affords residents access to transportation and, therefore, to job opportunities like those once held in Dominase ^Ponkrum (71% of the men interviewed and surveyed in Yesunkwa held wage-paying OFE). This OFE income does not replace farm income, but augments it, serving the same purpose as it did in the earlier context of Dominase ^Ponkrum.\\nAlthough persuasive, the circumstantial similarities between Yesunkwa and Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment require further support. Even if one accepts that Yesunkwa provides an adequate representation of conditions in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment, using aggregate data from Yesunkwa to infer local (that is, individual household) practices in pre-abandonment Dominase Ponkrum runs the risk of ecological fallacy. This problem can be ameliorated, to some degree, by comparing particular households in Yesunkwa to particular households in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment. Because such a one-to-one comparison is not possible through ethnographic means alone, we must turn to an alternative source of information. In this case, I employed archaeological techniques to examine the locations and uses of household social spaces in both Yesunkwa and preabandonment Dominase ^Ponkrum, spaces that are closely linked to economic roles and the social relations of the household in both contexts [see Carr (2001, pages 113 ^138) for a detailed discussion of the archaeological methods employed in this study].\\nFor example, in the households of Yesunkwa, spaces for food preparation (an activity conducted exclusively by women) are kept separate from spaces for food consumption (which typically involves the entire family at the same time) (figure 3). This separation of spaces clearly defines one of the roles of a woman in the household, differentiating her labor from that of her husband, father or brother, whose roles are to provide cash income for the household [for a discussion of the social spaces of the household in these contexts, see Carr (2001;2002)]. These spaces, and their distribution, are identical to those observed archaeologically in the households of Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment (figure 4, see over).\\nThe similarity between the pattern of household space seen in Yesunkwa and Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment becomes significant when one compares this pattern to that of contemporary Dominase ^Ponkrum, where cooking and eating take place in the same space (figure 5). The similar contexts of Yesunkwa and Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment display very similar patterns of household space. Despite sharing ethnicity, family connections and, in many cases, farmland with the households of Yesunkwa, the households of contemporary Dominase ^Ponkrum, with its primarily agricultural economy and limited transportation network, have an entirely different pattern of household space. This strongly suggests that the broad socioeconomic similarities between Yesunkwa and Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment do filter down to similarities between households, and perhaps household practice, in these two contexts.\\nGiven the general similarities in the economic and transportation situations, and the specific similarities between the household spaces and practices of these two villages, it is possible to draw analogies to the political economy of the household in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment from the political economy of the household in contemporary Yesunkwa. Our entre¨e into this past political economy begins with the social spaces of Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment. These spaces suggest a system of differentiations in this context very similar to Yesunkwa's, where the differentiation is based on gender and marked by the particular labor and value that men and women provided to the household. When one examines the other major source of income in Yesunkwa, agricultural production, it becomes apparent that men and women employ very similar agricultural strategies to achieve a similar goal: the production of crops for sale at market (table 1). Therefore, in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment, as in Yesunkwa today, the system of differentiation likely resulted from differential access to OFE opportunity.\\nIt is critical to understand the local agricultural and land-tenure system in Yesunkwa, which closely parallels that of other Akan groups throughout Ghana (see Awusabo-Asare, 1990;Brydon, 1987;Quisumbing et al, 1999;Quisumbing et al, 2001), when trying to understand the instrumental modes of power that come into play through this system of differentiation. Most relevant to the case at hand is the fact that women and men of the same household plant and control their respective incomes from separate, autonomous farms (see also Egyir, 1998, page 18). Akan households obtain land on an annual basis through the male head of family (who himself obtains this land through his clan's communal holdings). There are issues about the distribution of labor on household farms, especially regarding how much labor men contribute to women's farms, versus how much they demand of women on their own. Despite these issues, the fact remains that, come the harvest, Akan households like those in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment and in contemporary Yesunkwa are not dealing with a single pooled income, but rather with an aggregate of autonomous incomes.\\nPower becomes instrumentalized in Yesunkwa when men work around the economic autonomy of the women in their households by constructing a household economy that pools men's and women's incomes (figure 6). There is no basis for such an economy, or for the men's control of the other incomes in their households, in the land tenure or agricultural systems of the area. The justification for such an economy is that pooling the various incomes of the household creates a fund significant enough to guard against either the economic or the environmental instability that is threatened by local economic and environmental change.\\nWhat is unspoken in this justification is the fact that men tend to bring much more money into the household than women, and a pooling of incomes makes at least some of the OFE money available to the other members of the household. Though this pooling often leads to unjust uses of the household income (men often use much of this income for their own personal purchases, including alcohol and batteries for a radio that the owner tends to carry around for his own use), women do not contest the construction of a household economy (figure 6). I argue that men's control of OFE in Yesunkwa, and the disproportionate contribution to household safety and certainty OFE makes (women of such households, under normal circumstances, lack access to similar OFE opportunities), is a key differentiation emerging from household economic practice that links gender to financial contributions. This linking not only allows men to act upon the actions of the other members of their households, but also moves resistance to such action out of the realm of `possible actions' for women. The manifestation of power in the households of Yesunkwa, as in Dominase Ponkrum before the abandonment, creates a power/knowledge that binds together economy, environment, and society. The clear market orientation both of men's and of women's agricultural strategies, and the apparent importance of OFE income in structuring the household economy and social relations, strongly suggests that the solution to any instability lies in a market orientation and the income such an orientation provides. However, the use of a market orientation to offset economic and environmental uncertainty also reinforces the importance of men in the household (as primary earners), and therefore buttresses the system of differentiation through which power is manifest in these households. Thus, this system of differentiation, although apparently anchored in economic disparity, is not determined by such disparity. Instead, this disparity is given form in different practices (agricultural practice, efforts to negotiate economic and environmental instability) as they are enacted.\\nGiven the similarities between pre-abandonment Dominase ^Ponkrum and contemporary Yesunkwa, environmental issues in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment were likely to have been seen as issues manageable by economic means. In other words, it is likely that men's co-option of other incomes in their households in Dominase Ponkrum before the abandonment was an action that served as both a condition for and a result of a local power/knowledge that bore great similarity to that in existence today in Yesunkwa.\\nBut what of the very different pattern of social space seen in contemporary Dominase ^Ponkrum? If we examine the political economy of the contemporary households in this area, we can see how the material changes in this context threatened not only the material well-being of the residents in this area, but also the very power/knowledge that produced understandings of the world and reproduced men's ability to co-opt women's labor and income. There is little OFE opportunity in Dominase ^Ponkrum today (81% of those interviewed or surveyed make their living through agriculture alone, and there are no residents who rely on OFE alone for their livelihood) and, therefore, the current residents are much more closely tied to agriculture for their livelihoods than were past residents. Although the agricultural strategies of Yesunkwa suggest that, before the abandonment, agriculture in Dominase ^Ponkrum was not strongly differentiated between men and women and was generally oriented toward market sale of farm outputs, the current agricultural strategies display an interesting gendered differentiation. Today, men tend to plant crops they perceive as useful for market sale, while women tend to plant crops for subsistence production (table 2). At first glance, these agricultural strategies, when seen in a single household, appear to constitute a balanced strategy aimed at negotiating economic and environmental change. This is, however, a problematic interpretation, because in Dominase ^Ponkrum today, as well as before the abandonment, men and women plant separate, autonomous farms. To turn these disparate strategies into a coherent, balanced whole requires the coordination of, and therefore the control over, these incomes on the part of some member of the household. As in Dominase ^Ponkrum before the abandonment, men have this control.\\nUnlike their counterparts from before the abandonment, the men of contemporary Dominase ^Ponkrum lack the economic authority conveyed by a disproportionate contribution to the household economy. Their incomes, though drawn from a market-oriented agricultural strategy, rarely reach the levels of those with OFE in places like Yesunkwa. The system of differentiations visible in the agricultural strategies of this context therefore appears to be the echo of the previous system of differentiations between men and women. That is, this system of differentiation, although again taking shape around gender, is based upon the orientation of individual agricultural production, but not necessarily on the different amounts of income individuals contribute to the household. The division of men and women into market and subsistence producers, respectively, is a structural moment that emerges not through preexisting categories, but in the ongoing actions upon actions in this context. Yet the emergence of this structure creates an opportunity for men to co-opt women's farm output, giving instrumentality to this system by arguing for the pooling of the different household incomes to create a balanced means of negotiating the unstable local economy and environment (figure 7). As before the abandonment, this pooling creates situations in which men used the pooled income of their households for personal purchases. In the contemporary context, however, there are clear voices of dissent from the women whose income is co-opted (figure 7), rising through reference to the land-tenure system that grants them autonomous control over their incomes. Men's lack of income dominance in contemporary Dominase ^Ponkrum opens up opportunities for such resistance, as the women of their household do not necessarily gain greater safety and certainty from the man's financial contributions to the household than they could provide themselves. This returns us to the social spaces of the household in contemporary Dominase Ponkrum. Just as the separation of food preparation and food consumption spaces in the other villages is a marker of social roles within the household, so we can read the social roles within the households of Dominase ^Ponkrum through the overlap of these spaces. Here, however, the use of social spaces appears to be an effort to undo the clear marking of social roles that once worked to reinforce the authority of men in this context. Whether this undoing is the work of men seeking to obscure their failing base of social and material capital, or of women seeking to make clear the failing authority of men over their households, these spaces reflect a changed status for men in this context, one in which their authority over their households is somewhat diminished and far more challenged than before.\\nDespite the voices (and spatial markers) of dissent in this context, men tend to control the various incomes in their houses to their own ends, though this often provokes domestic disputes. This happens because power/knowledge takes a different shape in the contemporary context than it did forty years ago. Before the abandonment, residents saw economic and environmental changes as issues to be solved by greater market involvement, and the greater incomes this involvement could bring. As we have seen, this focus on market involvement also served to support men's economic superiority in the household and, therefore, their capacity to co-opt the incomes of the members of their households. According to today's power/knowledge in Dominase Ponkrum, economic and environmental changes are issues to be dealt with through a balanced approach incorporating both cash and subsistence strategies to weather any and all situations. Such a blended strategy requires coordination, which men provide by creating a household economy that serves to link the disparate incomes of men and women. This definition of economic and environmental change as an issue to be dealt with through a differentiated strategy rests on or produces a system of differentiations that are both the conditions for and the results of the economic roles of different members of the household, in this case their agricultural goals. Furthermore, this definition of economic and environmental change gives an instrumentality to these differentiations by creating a need to coordinate these incomes. Though voiced strongly, women's resistance remains verbal because they continue to plant for subsistence. Thus, women's subsistence farming represents their understanding of possible actions in the face of local power/knowledge, which defines the causes of and solutions for economic and environmental change. Power/knowledge and migration\\nThe comparison of Dominase ^Ponkrum before and after the abandonment suggests that economic and environmental changes in the area have shifted men from a position of largely unchallenged authority, as heads of their households, to a more tenuous position. The power/knowledge undergirding household social relations that enable men's control over various household incomes has shifted. With this in mind, we can return to the complex issue of abandonment of this area to seek out differentiations in the abandonment, and explore how the changing power/knowledge informed particular migration decisions.\\nIn Dominase ^Ponkrum of the late 1960s, the households leaving the area first were headed by younger men (usually under the age of 30), or by widowed women. Those that left more than ten years after 1970 were exclusively headed by women who were leaving directly after the death of the elderly male head of household. The complexity of this migration response reflects not only the changing material context, but also the changing social context that challenged local power/knowledge. I begin by considering the older (usually around 50 years old or more) men who, in choosing not to leave the village, kept their households in place for up to two decades. These men lived out their lives in Dominase ^Ponkrum and when they died their widows relocated the family to sites like Yesunkwa (for the moment I will leave aside the widows, for they fit into another group of decisionmakers who left the village and are best addressed separately). Exposed to the same economic, food, and environmental insecurity as the other residents of the villages, the older men's decision to stay in Dominase ^Ponkrum was closely linked to the struggle for control of household incomes, and indeed the household itself, in this context. The declining economic and agricultural situation in Dominase ^Ponkrum meant less income in the hands of men, and therefore a reduced capacity for dealing with these changes (as economic and environmental change was addressed through market-oriented production under this power/knowledge). This in turn undermined their justification for control over the other incomes produced within their households. For older men, migration to a periurban context and the associated OFE market was not an opportunity, but rather a move to a competitive setting where they lacked established social networks and the skills (either a strong back or an education) needed for economic success. Thus, relocation to periurban or urban settlements would not serve to alleviate the intrahousehold pressure placed upon these men by the loss of cash income, because they lacked the ability to make up that income in the form of consistent wage labor that would offset the higher cost of living in periurban or urban settings.\\nOn the other hand, as senior members of their lineages, these men had access to other local social relations that provided a basis for another system of differentiation that could be instrumentalized. They controlled not only the access of their households to land, but also the access to land for many households of men more junior than they. In a context where agriculture had always been the basis of the local economy, agriculture was rapidly becoming the only means of making a living. Thus, this access to land became a defining characteristic of interhousehold social relations, a characteristic with tremendous potential for the exercise of authority resulting in the collection of material resources (for example, the token payments, in cash and liquor, made by members of the lineage to the head of the lineage for access to land). These resources, both material and social, served as an alternative contribution to the well-being of the household. Consequently, for these older men periurban Ghana did not represent opportunity, but rather greater risk than staying in place despite great change in the material well-being of their households.\\nGiven this perspective, we can examine the other migrating households and come to a richer understanding of their actions. In the households of younger males, the growing economic, food, and environmental insecurity drove migration as the resultant loss of income and resources threatened the local power/knowledge that authorized their co-option of household incomes. Within this power/knowledge, cash income was the source of safety and certainty. Thus, men's disproportionate contribution of such income to the household represents a justification for the cooption of household incomes. Without such cash income, men lacked a clear justification for this co-option. Periurban settings with access to OFE opportunity were doubly inviting for these men because they provided an opportunity to regain household income not only to offset material change, but also to buttress the power/knowledge that enabled their continuing access to the other incomes of the household. Therefore, although at first glance a rational choice model of migration decisionmaking anchored only in material changes and needs might appear to explain the decisionmaking for this set of households, in this case such a model oversimplifies the decisionmaking of this group.\\nUnlike their male counterparts, women at the head of households did not share a concern for maintaining social power. Nor were they forced to leave the area because of inheritance issues, because in Dominase ^Ponkrum they had the right to continue farming land granted to them by their husband after his death. In the contemporary context a few such female-headed households in Yesunkwa still maintain farms in the vicinity of Dominase ^Ponkrum, even after moving out of the area. Instead, it was the decline of the local transportation network (brought on by the end of logging, the enterprise that had maintained this network for motorized traffic) that most impacted women's decisions to move. A large number of contemporary residents of Dominase ^Ponkrum, when asked why some residents left the village for other locations, responded ``because there were no lorries.'' Women in these villages bore (and still bear) the responsibility for transporting crops and goods to and from market. The loss of access to improved transportation greatly increased their workload on the days of the week they had to go to market, as without such transportation they had to walk. Relocation to a periurban setting with easy access to transportation networks and to farmland reduced some of this transportation-related labor.\\nThough it appears that the environmental changes in this area had little effect on the decisionmaking of these women, the act of selling at market is closely linked to the same power/knowledge that shaped the migration decisions of other households in these villages. In the end, it is irrelevant whether cash income was the exclusive means of dealing with economic and environmental change in Dominase ^Ponkrum or part of a balanced strategy aimed at the same goal: in either case, the cash component of the strategy required someone (women) to make trips to market to sell crops. Women's acceptance of this role implies an acceptance of the changing solution to economic and environmental change underlying the local power/knowledge. It is only through a disengagement with market sale that women in this context can break with local power/knowledge, the resultant understandings of environment and economy, and the solutions for dealing with changes in both. The understanding of environmental change under the local power/knowledge is therefore a subtle, yet crucial, part of this particular set of migration decisions.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion: power, environment, migration': 'In this paper I sought to show a nuanced view of the role of the environment in migration decisions seen in rural, marginal contexts by presenting a framework that allows us to examine how the environment, economy, and society are linked in migration decisionmaking. From this it is possible to evaluate the relative importance of environmental change in a given case. With this framework I have built upon the minimalist perspective in environmental migration that one cannot productively think of environmental drivers of migration without considering economic and political considerations. I have also been able to employ, with this framework, a Foucauldian notion of power as an intrinsic part of social relations shaping or shaped by local understandings of environment, economy, and society. By examining the ways social differentiation is instrumentalized into a particular manifestation of power in a given context and the ways in which resistance to this manifestation forms, we can gain an entre¨e to particular power/knowledges and, therefore, to the worldview from within which actors make migration decisions. In this framework, environmental change is rarely a sufficient basis for the decision to migrate (the obvious exception being catastrophic change, such as volcanic eruption or coastal inundation) because environmental change is understood only through local power/knowledge. However, we cannot ever exclude the environment from migration decisionmaking because it is a key element of any local power/knowledge and, therefore, always impacts migration decisions. All migrants are environmental migrants in some form or other. Some, like the younger men in Dominase ^Ponkrum, are environmental migrants in that changes to the local environment, while perhaps not creating an imminent threat to their material well-being, were part of a developing threat to their social status. Other migrants, like the households headed by women in Dominase ^Ponkrum, appear to have migrated for reasons that barely reference environmental change at all. Yet the apparently economic drivers of this migration are predicated on a larger power/knowledge tied, in part, to a particular understanding of the local environment.\\nThe understanding of how environmental, economic, and political change are bound together in households through local power/knowledge affords us a key insight into the decisionmaking of migrants that helps us to better understand, and plan for, the initial decision to migrate. Further, a nuanced understanding of conflict and power at the level of the household provides an understanding of migration decisionmaking that offers insights into future migration paths for those moving to periurban or urban contexts.\\nTo move away from an environment-only approach to the presentation and study of the role of the environment in migration and refugee decisionmaking is not to remove the environment from these conversations. Rather, in many cases, integrating the environment into a minimalist perspective that carefully considers how the environment becomes integrated with economic and political considerations in a particular context may improve the visibility of the role of environment in migration. The environment, and changes in that environment, is an important part of everyday life in rural, marginal contexts. To put the environment in its place in migration studies is to create more nuanced understandings of its importance to residents of such contextsöunderstandings not easily rebuffed by skeptics.'},\n",
       " 6: {'abstract': 'Climate change, especially the warming trend experienced in recent years by several countries, could affect agricultural productivity. As a consequence the income of rural populations will change, and with it the incentives for people to remain in rural areas. Using data from 115 countries between 1960 and 2000, we analyze the effect of differential warming trends across countries on the probability of either migrating out of the country or from rural to urban areas. We find that higher temperatures in middle-income economies increased migration rates to urban areas and to other countries. In poor countries, higher temperatures reduced the probability of migration to cities and to other countries, consistently with the presence of severe liquidity constraints. In middle-income countries, migration represents an important margin of adjustment to global warming, potentially contributing to structural change and even increasing income per worker. Such a mechanism, however, does not seem to work in poor economies.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"One of the best demonstrated long-run effects of rising average surface temperature is its negative effect on productivity in agriculture. The optimal yield of agricultural products has been adjusted to local temperature for centuries and many studies (e.g. Burke et al., 2015) have shown that agricultural GDP peaks at the average yearly temperature of around 14 • C and declines for higher temperatures. Hence, as most of the world population and economic activity reside in countries with average temperatures around or above 14 • , several studies find that productivity decreases as temperature increases beyond a country's historical average (Burke et al., 2015;Cline, 2007;Dell et al., 2014;IPCC, 2014). While some studies find that nonagricultural GDP may also decline for yearly temperatures above 14-15 • , it also appears that the productivity decline is less steep and less precisely measured for non-agricultural sectors (see Fig. 2d ande in Burke et al., 2015). Agriculture is still a very relevant source of income and employment in poor countries, especially in rural areas.\\nOne potentially important margin of adjustment to declining agricultural productivity in poor countries is migration from rural to urban areas, either within the home country or towards another country. While some papers have begun to analyze how warming may affect income per person across countries over the long run (e.g. Dell et al., 2012), and other studies have analyzed the connection between temperature/precipitation and human migration in some specific countries (e.g. Bohra-Mishra et al., 2014;Dillon et al., 2011;Gray and Mueller, 2012a;Mueller et al., 2014), few studies look at the systematic long-run effect of temperature change on emigration and rural-to-urban migration in poor and middle-income countries in the world. 1 This paper gathers data and proposes a model and simple empirical framework to analyze the impact of temperature change on emigration rates in countries where agriculture is still an important sector and many migrants originate from rural areas.\\nBy impoverishing the rural population of poor countries and worsening their income perspectives, long-term warming may affect migration in different ways, depending on the initial income of those rural populations. As previously suggested by studies such as Mayda (2010), a decline in the income of the sending country may have a depressing effect on the share of emigrants from very poor countries. In these countries, individuals of rural communities are near subsistence, so a lower income worsens their liquidity constraint, implying that potential migrants have a reduced ability to pay migration costs. In this case, global warming may trap very poor rural workers, making them unable to leave agriculture and potentially worsening their poverty. To the contrary, in countries in which individuals are not extremely poor, a decline in agricultural income may provide incentives to migrate to cities or abroad. Decreasing agricultural productivity may encourage a mechanism that ultimately leads to shifting people out of agriculture into urban environments. The inverted U-shape of migration rates as a function of income per person in the countries of origin is usually rationalized in this type of framework. However, we are not aware of a simple formalization of this model nor of a clean analysis which tests this non-monotonic effect by exploiting variation of an exogenous determinant of productivity, such as temperature.\\nIn this paper we are the first to extend the classical Roy-Borjas model (Borjas, 1987;Roy, 1951) and we use this framework to analyze the effects of exogenous changes in agricultural productivity (due to temperature increase) and its opposite effects on the probability of emigration for poor or middle-income countries. In particular, the model predicts that a long-run increase in temperature decreases the income of rural populations in very poor countries, generates a poverty trap and lowers the probability of emigration. To the contrary, in middle-income countries the decline in agricultural productivity pushes emigrants out of rural areas. This stimulates urbanization and may speed the country's structural transformation, ultimately increasing its income per person. In accordance with the model's predictions, we find that in very poor countries increasing temperature leads to lower emigration and urbanization rates, while in middle-income countries it leads to larger rates. We also show that long-run temperature increase speeds the transition away from agriculture in middle-income countries. Conversely, it slows this transition in poor countries -worsening the poverty trap -as poor rural workers become less likely to move to cities or abroad. We also find, for middle-income countries, emigration induced by higher temperature is local and is associated with growth in average GDP per person, while the decline in emigration and urbanization in poor countries is associated with lower average GDP per person.\\nThe literature has emphasized the relationship between temperature and income per person is likely nonlinear. Changes in income/productivity are either relatively small or even positive for average yearly temperatures between 10 and 20 • C, while a decline occurs for temperatures above a threshold located around 20/25 • . This implies that increases in temperature are more damaging, especially in agricultural output, above a certain value. In our analysis, we consider this type of nonlinearity by testing whether temperature increases have a nonlinear positive (or negative) effect on the migration probability of its citizens. We emphasize, however, that the behavior of migration with respect to temperature largely depends on the initial income of the country of origin. Similarly, a productivity decline will have a different effect in poor or middle-income countries due to prevailing liquidity constraints or incentive mechanisms. We find that the nonlinearity of the temperature effect is less relevant than the interaction of temperature with initial income for the migration response. Poor countries experience different temperature effects on migration relative to middle-income countries because of their lower income (likely to worsen liquidity constraints) and not because they are also hot.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on climate and international migrations. Section 3 presents a simple variation of the Borjas-Roy model relating agricultural productivity to migration rates at different income levels.\\nSection 4 describes the data and variables, and Section 5 presents the main empirical specifications and the main estimates of the effects of warming on migrations. Section 6 shows some robustness checks, and Section 7 checks that the climate-migration connection is consistent with the estimated effects of climate on structural change and GDP across countries. Section 8 concludes the paper.\",\n",
       "  'Literature review': 'The literature analyzing the effects of weather and climate events on migration is recent and growing. Several papers have analyzed the impact of episodes of drought, high temperature, or low precipitation on rural emigration in specific countries. 2 Because of its extreme poverty and its dependence on agricultural production, Sub-Saharan Africa has received great attention. Most of the existing studies on this area analyze the year-to-year correlation between weather phenomena and migration, and mainly identify temporary displacements rather than long-term trends. In multi-country studies of Sub-Saharan Africa, Barrios et al. (2006) analyze the link between average rainfall and urbanization, and Marchiori et al. (2012) estimate how temperature and precipitation anomalies have affected migration.\\nA case that has also been studied in depth is the connection between weather/climate and migration out of Mexico. Looking at Mexico-US migration, Munshi (2003) is the first to show the connection between low rainfall and migration rates. More recently, Feng et al. (2010) confirm the relation between weather and migration from Mexico. However, Auffhammer and Vincent (2012) demonstrate that this effect vanishes after they control for a richer set of covariates.\\nOverall, the existing literature on weather change and migration focuses on within country data or uses yearly migration rates. Hence it fails to provide a general picture of the potential long-run effect of weather changes on migration within and across countries that span a range of income levels. Beine and Parsons (2015) use decade data, but they do not directly tackle the question regarding the effect of changes in average temperature on migration in the long-run. The paper produces an accurate study that focuses on bilateral migration and analyzes the impact of extreme weather events, deviations and anomalies in temperatures from the long-run averages, after one controls for many other bilateral factors. An even more recent paper by Backhaus et al. (2015) performs a similar analysis on yearly data, considering average temperature as the main explanatory variable. Both of these papers focus on partial effects of temperature and of extreme weather events as they control for productivity and income of country of origin. We think, however, the more relevant question is to identify the total effect of temperature on emigration, test interactions with the income level of the country of origin, disentangle potential nonlinearities in temperature and suggest potential channels and explanations.\\nOur paper does exactly this. It differs from previous work by considering all countries of the world, explicitly analyzing the effects of temperature on internal and international migration within a simple Roy-Borjas model of migration and average productivity. In so doing, we are able to identify a crucial and plausible distinction of the effect of temperature increases on migration from poor and middleincome countries and test whether such a distinction, and other additional implications, are supported by the data. The interaction of temperature with initial income turns out to be more crucial than the nonlinearity of the temperature effect in shaping the relation between temperature and migration. Moreover, our analysis of international migration, as well as urbanization (driven by internal migration), provides consistent results for internal and international migration. This consistency adds credibility to our results.\\nDifferently from Beine and Parsons (2015) and Backhaus et al. (2015), we do not control for income and productivity, but consider their variation as a pathway that links temperature and migration. As income and productivity are affected by temperature (and not independent of it) our approach allows the identification of the total impact of temperature on migration, rather than isolating its partial effect, and then assesses the potential channels. A paper close to our approach, in that it estimates the total effect of temperature on migration, is Cai et al. (2014). The authors analyze how yearly bilateral migration flows depend on yearly temperatures for a panel of 163 countries of origin into 42 OECD destinations for the period 1980-2010. The structure of the analysis implies these are short-run elasticity responses (within the year) and the analysis only includes migration to OECD countries. The authors do not separate between poor and middle-income countries, nor do they look at internal migration. They use potentially noisy data on gross flows of migrants, instead of Census-based data on net migrations. Significant shortrun temporary migration can be captured by that design. We are the first paper to provide long-run impacts of slow-changing temperature and precipitation on internal and international migration rates for poor and middle-income countries.',\n",
       "  'A simple framework': '',\n",
       "  'The migration decision': 'Consider two countries defined as \"Poor\", P, and \"Middle-Income\", M, where workers -who are potential migrants to a third country, \"Rich\", R-live and work. We consider a very simple twoperiod model, in the spirit of Roy-Borjas (Borjas, 1987;Roy, 1951), that delivers a \"hump-shaped\" emigration rate as a function of the country of origin\\'s income per person (consistently with the empirical literature from Zelinsky, 1971to Hatton and Williamson, 1994, 2003, 2011). While the Roy model is broadly used in the analysis of migrant selection, we are not aware of any paper that extends it to explain the hump-shaped relation between migration rate and income per person. Hence we find it useful to present it, compactly, in its entirety.\\nIn the first period, individuals differ in their skills, work in their country of origin (P or M), and earn the local wage. At the beginning of the second period, individuals choose between migrating to country R or staying in their country, based on the comparison of their wage in the second period. If they stay in the country of origin they earn w iJ . If they migrate to R they earn w iR , but must pay up-front monetary and non-monetary migration costs. Without loss of insight we assume individuals have 0 discount rate, the wage in the country of origin for periods 1 and 2 are identical, and no uncertainty exists. The wage of individual i in country of origin J (J = P, M) in the first and second periods can be written as:\\nw iJ = l J + b J e i J = P, M (1)\\nwhere l J is the basic income/wage in country J earned by a person with median skills. We can imagine that this term depends positively on agricultural productivity -among other factors -especially as the economy of country P and M depends on agriculture-related sectors. Through agricultural productivity, therefore, the median income in country J depends on its temperature T J , expressed as: l J (T J ). The term b J represents the return to skills in country J. The term e i is a measure of skills of individual i that we assume, for simplicity, as being normally distributed with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. If the same individual were to migrate to country R he/she would earn the following wage instead:\\nw iR = l R + b R e i (2)\\nFor simplicity we have assumed that the skills of the individual, measured by e i , are perfectly transferable from P or M to country R. However, the returns to skills in country R are different than in the origin country. Following strong evidence from the existing literature (Grogger and Hanson, 2011;Ortega and Peri, 2012) we assume that the rich country has higher median wage and higher skill premium than the poor and middle-income countries. Moreover, following most of the literature on climate change (Dell et al., 2014), we assume temperature changes have an effect on agricultural productivity (relevant for country J = P, M ), but not (or much less) on non-agricultural productivity (relevant for country R). Therefore, the dependence of l R on T J can be ignored. These assumptions correspond to the following restrictions on the parameters: l R > l J and b R > b J for J = P, M. 3 For simplicity, we also assume the distribution of skills, e i , is identical in country P and M and the cost of migrating from either of them to R, the rich country, is equal and can be expressed as (C Mon + C Non ), where C Mon are monetary costs of migrating -such as cost of relocating, traveling, and searching -while C Non are the non-monetary (psychological) costs. Both are expressed in units of labor compensation. Following Grogger and Hanson (2011), we assume individuals have linear preferences in their net wages (i.e. wages net of migration costs) and, within this very simple framework, the decision to migrate for individual i implies a comparison between the net income when migrating and staying. Thus, the individual will migrate from country J to R if:\\nl R + b R e i -C Mon -C Non > l J + b J e i ,\\n( 3 ) or more simply:\\ne i > l J (T J ) -l R + C Mon + C Non b R -b J . (4\\n)\\nIn the literature, condition (4) has been typically thought of as a \"selection\" equation. The parameter restriction b R > b J implies \"positive selection\". Namely, only individuals with skills above a certain level have incentives to migrate. This is consistent with abundant evidence as summarized, for instance, in Docquier et al. (2011). Alternatively, we can see Eq. ( 4) as an incentive-compatible constraint. Namely, individuals from country J will migrate only if their gains from migration (wages at destination) exceed the opportunity cost (wage at home) plus migration costs (monetary and non-monetary).\\nThe lower the threshold in Eq. ( 4), the larger is the share of individuals for which the incentive constraint is satisfied.\\nThe migration decision must also satisfy a \"feasibility\" constraint. If we assume that migration takes place at the beginning of the second period and individuals in country P and M cannot borrow (liquidity constraint), then they can migrate only if the monetary costs of migration do not exceed their total savings at the end of period 1, which, in our simple model, is at most equal to w iJ . With labor as the only source of income and assuming that monetary costs of migration must be paid up front, the feasibility condition -or liquidity constraint -can be written simply as: (5) or:\\nl J (T J ) + b J e i > C Mon\\ne i > C Mon -l J (T J ) b J (6)',\n",
       "  'Implications on emigration rates': 'The fraction of people who will migrate from country J is equal to one minus the cumulative density of a normal distribution at the highest of the two thresholds defined in Eqs. ( 4) and ( 6). For each country, only one of the two thresholds can be binding. It is easy to see that the \"incentive-compatible\" threshold (4) is increasing in the \"median\" income l J (T J ), while the \"liquidity-constraint\" threshold ( 6) is decreasing in it. The monotonicity of the two thresholds implies that there is a value of l * J T * J for which they are identical and we consider that value as marking the divide between \"Poor\" (P) and \"Middle income\" (M) countries. 4 Hence, this model provides two very clear predictions: Proposition 1. For middle-income countries, an increase in average temperature is associated with an increase in the emigration rate.\\nProof. For countries whose median income is higher than l * J (T * J ), defined as middle-income countries, M, only the threshold (4) is binding. Hence the share of people migrating is the one with skills above that threshold, given by:\\nMig M Pop M = 1 -V l J (T J ) -l R + C Mon + C Non b R -b J (7)\\nwhere V is the CDF of a standard normal distribution. The expression on the right hand side is decreasing in l J (because the CDF V is a monotonically increasing function). If we assume that increases in temperature T decrease basic agricultural productivity l J , then the expression is increasing in T J .\\nProposition 2. For poor countries an increase in average temperature is associated with a decrease in the emigration rate.\\nProof. For countries whose median income is lower than l * J T * J , defined as poor countries, P, differently than for the other group, only the liquidity threshold (6) is binding. Hence the share of people migrating is the one with skills above that threshold, given by:\\nMig P Pop P = 1 -V C Mon -l J (T J ) b J (8\\n)\\nwhere V is the CDF of a standard normal distribution. The expression on the right hand side is now increasing in l J . If, as before, we assume that increases in temperature T decrease median productivity l J , then the expression above would be decreasing in T J .\\n4 That value is defined as:\\nl * J T * J = (bR-bJ)CMon+bJ(lR-CMon-CNon) b R\\nThe intuition in both cases is straightforward. Lower agricultural productivity implies lower median income. In middle-income countries this effect increases the incentive (and hence the probability) of migrating and hence raises the emigration rate, as in those countries the liquidity constraint does not bind. In poor countries, instead, the liquidity constraint is binding. Hence, lower agricultural productivity makes people poorer, decreasing their ability to pay migration costs, hence reducing the emigration rate. For these countries the incentive to migrate is very high, but individuals are simply too poor to afford migration, which is only worsened by lower agricultural productivity.\\nBy taking logarithms and log-linearizing both sides of each Eqs. ( 7) and ( 8) and merging them into one equation, we obtain the basic equation for our analysis. Namely, considering a generic country j that can be M (middle-income) or P (poor) we can write:\\nln Mig j Pop j = a + c ln T j + c P ln T j * D( j ∈ P) + bC j (9)\\nIn Eq. ( 9) the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the migration rates from country j and it depends on the logarithm of the average temperatures in the country, ln T j . To capture the different dependence in poor and middle-income countries, we allow for a linear term whose coefficient c captures the effect of temperature on emigration rates in middle-income countries. We then add an interaction with the dummy D(j ∈ P) that is equal to 1 if country j is a poor country, for which the \"liquidity threshold\" is binding and 0 otherwise. With this notation, the parameter c captures the elasticity of emigration rates to average temperature for medium-income countries and c +c P captures the elasticity for poor countries. The term C j captures potential determinants of migration costs in country of origin j. Let us also notice that if we interpret \"R as the urban areas and M and P as the rural areas in the middleincome or poor country, the model above can be interpreted as a model of rural-to-urban migration. Even in that case, it makes sense that migration is skill-intensive and the incentive condition affects migration in middle-income countries, while the liquidity constraint affects it in poor countries. Hence, the consequence of warming would be more urbanization in middle-income countries, but less urbanization in very poor countries. The prediction of the model can be summarized, within the compact format of expression (9) above, as follows:\\n1. As the average temperature of a middle-income country increases, reducing its agricultural productivity relative to urban productivity, we expect workers to migrate abroad and to the cities at higher rate. Therefore the model predicts c > 0.\\n2. As the average temperature of a poor country increases, reducing its agricultural productivity, we expect workers whose average income is very low to have fewer resources to pay for their migration possibilities. Therefore the model predicts c + c P < 0.\\nOur empirical analysis focuses on estimating the link between temperature and emigration, and will provide important evidence to evaluate the predictions of the model.',\n",
       "  'Data and summary statistics': 'In order to test the empirical predictions of the model, we merge data on the average temperature and on international migration and urbanization for all available countries in the world between 1960 and 2000. 5 The data on temperatures are taken from Dell et al. (2012). In our empirical specifications we also control for a measure of annual precipitation, whose long-run behavior can affect agricultural productivity. This variable is used as a control in Dell et al. (2012) because changes in precipitation can be an important aspect of long-run climate trends affecting agricultural productivity. Moreover, given that precipitation and temperature are historically correlated, both temperature and precipitation need to be included in the empirical specification to obtain unbiased coefficients (Auffhammer et al., 2013). The (terrestrial) monthly mean temperature and precipitation data at 0.5 × 0.5 • resolution, obtained from weather stations (Matsuura and Willmott, 2007), are aggregated into country-year averages using the population in 1990 at 30 arc second resolution (CIESIN et al., 2004) as weights. In an alternative approach, used as a robustness check, the weather station data are averaged using area, rather than population, weights. In some specifications, in order to analyze whether long-term warming affects countries by increasing the probability of extreme weather events, we also include the incidence of droughts, floods, storms and extreme heat as controls. Those data are taken from the International Disaster Database compiled by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (Guha-Sapir et al., 2015).\\nThe migration data are taken from Ozden et al. (2011), and include bilateral migrant stocks between 115 countries in the last five available census years spanning the period from 1960 to 2000. The advantage of these data is that they include migrations from 115 countries to 115 countries, so many more destinations than only considering OECD (as done in Cai et al., 2014). The other advantage is that the sources of these data are national Censuses, and the data are much more accurate in counting foreign-born individuals as compared to flow measures. The data are only available every ten years and hence we can capture long-run migration tendencies but not short-run temporary migration flows. Our analysis is focused on long-run relationships.\\nDrawing from the bilateral data, we compute net emigration flows as differences between stocks in two consecutive Censuses. We first sum all net flows for the same countries of origin and compute emigration rates as the ratio between the aggregate net flow of emigrants in the decade relative to the origin country population at the beginning of the decade. 6 The data on urbanization rates are taken from the World Urbanization Prospects (UN, 2014). They measure the share of the population of a country living in urban areas between 1950 and 2000 available over ten year intervals. Data on the value added in agriculture are from the World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2015). For GDP per capita the main sources are the Penn World Table (2009) and the World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2015).\\nConsistently with our model, the set of countries of origin we consider for our analysis are those that can be considered \"poor\" or \"middle-income\" according to their income per person. These are the countries for which temperature changes may have the largest productivity effect because agriculture contributes a significant share of GDP. To define poor and middle-income countries we first keep only non-OECD countries for a total of 115 countries as part of our sample. 7 We then consider poor countries those in the bottom quartile of the non-OECD income per capita distribution, PPP-adjusted  and measured in 1990. 8 According to this definition, we identify a list of 30 poor countries, and 85 middle-income countries (see the Data Appendix for each list). Given that there is no clear definition of a poor country, we conduct some robustness checks to detect whether modifying the threshold implies different results. The countries near the threshold between poor and middle-income, with this definition, are those with yearly income per person around $1500 in 1990. This is a low threshold and it implies a large share of the \"poor\" countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa. For rural population in these countries the liquidity constraint is clearly very relevant as most of them likely live on an income of a few dollars per day. Saving the hundreds of dollars needed to emigrate can be very hard for these families. The threshold between middle-income and rich countries is instead around $15,000 per person in 1990, about the income per person of Portugal or Greece. Rich countries are important destinations for migrants from poor and middle-income countries of origin, but they are not included in our analysis as sending countries.\\nTable 1 provides the summary statistics of the variables of interest for the two groups of sending countries (poor and middle-income), separately. Several features of the data are worth discussing. First, the average ten-year emigration rate for middle-income countries is 4.2%, including migration to both OECD and non-OECD destinations. This average is much higher than for poor countries, whose decennial net rate is 1.8%. This is consistent with the idea that emigration rate grows with income, up to a certain level. Second, income per capita and urbanization rates are much higher in middle-income countries than in poor countries. In particular, the share of urban population is 42% in middle-income countries and only 19% in poor countries. Both are far from the level of urbanization in rich countries (around 75%). Additionally, a substantial share of value-added production in poor countries comes from agriculture, around 35%, and agriculture is a non-negligible source of GDP (accounting for about 16%) in mediumincome countries, as well.\\nThe differences in emigration rates and temperature trends are depicted in Figs. 1 and2. The graphs show the evolution of emigration rates and temperature for ten selected poor and middle-income countries, chosen to be each at a decile of the overall distribution for the total change on four decades. In each figure we standardize the average emigration rate and average temperature of each country in the first decade to zero, making even small variations apparent.\\nPanel 1 of Fig. 1 shows that emigration rates are relatively stable during the period in middle-income countries, with most countries experiencing changes of only a few percentage points. Exceptions are Albania, whose emigration rate increased 28 percentage points, and Algeria, whose emigration rate decreased, especially between the first and second decades, by 9 percentage points. For poor countries, in Panel 2 of Fig. 1, we observe a larger proportion of emigration rates that increase over time, relative to those decreasing. We also observe a significant amount of variation.\\nAs for average temperature, Fig. 2 shows that over the considered period, temperature increased in the large majority of middleincome and poor countries. As one can see from Panels 1 and 2 of the figure, the last decade was generally warmer for all countries relative to the first. The temperature changes over the period are in fact positive with the exception of countries in the bottom decile of the distribution of temperature changes. We also observe significant variation in the amount of warming experienced over three decades, Note: The first three columns of the table show the summary statistics including as country of origin of immigrants non-OECD countries, excluding those in the bottom quartile of the GDP per capita distribution. The remaining three columns show the summary statistics for the sample of non-OECD countries in the bottom quartile of the per-capita GDP distribution. The sample is supposed to include countries of the world that are \"Poor\" or \"Middle-Income\".\\nwith a range of about 1 • C separating the top 10% from the bottom 10%, both in the middle-income and poor country samples. Fig. 3 shows the most interesting stylized fact. It plots long-term changes in temperature against long-term changes in emigration rates for poor and middle-income countries separately, along with a fitted regression line. In particular, we take the difference between the (natural log of) average temperature and emigration rates in the first two decades (1960-80) and in the last two decade (1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) of our data and plot one against the other. The difference in the relationship between the two groups of countries is clear.  Middle-income countries show a positive (albeit not strong) correlation while poor countries show a negative and significant correlation between temperature changes (expressed in logs) and emigration. Qualitatively these are the types of correlations predicted by our model. We will test the robustness of these correlations more systematically in the next section.',\n",
       "  'Empirical specification and results': 'Following specification (9) suggested by the model, we estimate the following empirical specification:\\nY j,t = a + c ln(T j,t ) + c P ln(T j,t ) * D j + d ln(P j,t ) + d P ln(P j,t ) * D j +0 j + 0 r,t + 0 p,t + 4 j,t(10)\\nThe variable Y j,t captures the outcome of interest in country j and in the decade beginning with year t (= 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990). It will be alternatively the natural logarithm of the emigration rates (described in the previous section) or the average urbanization rate, computed as the urban population over the total population of country j during the decade beginning in t.9 T j,t represents the average temperature of country j during each decade beginning with year t and P j,t captures the ten year average precipitation. The inclusion of both temperature and precipitation in the estimated specification follows the literature that studies the effect of climate change on any outcome. Both the natural logarithm of the temperature and of the precipitation are entered linearly, as well as interacted with the dummy D j ,that equals one if country j is categorized as \"Poor\". This allows different elasticity estimates for poor and middle-income countries, a point emphasized in the model. We also include country fixed effects, 0 j , capturing fixed country characteristics such as their geography and institutions. The term 0 r,t captures region-decade dummies in order to absorb regional factors of variation in economic conditions over time and 0 p,t are decade fixed effects interacted with a poor country dummy, to capture differential time variation in the group of countries considered as \"poor\" relative to those considered as \"middle-income\". 4 j,t is a random error term that can have a correlation within country, hence our choice to cluster at the country level when estimating.\\nAs emphasized in the previous section, we only consider a sample of middle-income and poor countries of origin. In the main specifications we include only non-OECD countries of origin equating OECD to rich countries. The dummy for \"poor\" countries is defined as equal to one for countries in the bottom quartile of the sample income distribution in the non-OECD sample. In robustness checks, we try different definitions of \"rich\" and \"poor\" countries by varying the threshold for the definition of rich countries. Results are robust to these alterations. Specification ( 10) is based on the model presented in Section 3. It also represents a simple reduced-form linear relationship between temperature and migration allowing such a relation to vary depending on the initial income per person in the country of origin. While it is clear that average temperature is an exogenous variable, the real question is: through what channels does temperature operate on migration? In our model and analysis we focus on specific implications of a model in which the main channel operates through a decrease in agricultural productivity and rural income, both of which are not easily observable variables for our panel of countries. One option would be to include several controls such as population size, socio-political environment, probability of conflicts and others in the regression to reduce the scope of omitted channels. However, as those variables may themselves be affected by agricultural productivity, including them may produce a bias in the estimation by introducing an over-controlling problem. The estimation of an equation that controls for both temperature and other variables that are influenced by the temperature or agricultural productivity would not capture the total net effect of temperature on migration (Dell et al., 2014). The paper by Beine and Parsons (2015), for instance, introduces a very large number of controls and does not find a correlation between temperature and bilateral migration. By absorbing many potential variables correlated with agricultural productivity in the regression, that paper may obscure some of the effects we are considering. Therefore, we decided to remain parsimonious in our models (as done in Couttenier and Soubeyran, 2014;Dell et al., 2012;Jones and Olken, 2010) by including only fixed effects as controls. We then directly analyze the potential channels of the effects by assessing the impact of temperature on income per person and agricultural value-added as outcomes to see whether the estimated effects on those variables are consistent with the working of our model. Note: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of emigration rates in Columns ( 1) and ( 2) and the urbanization rates in Columns ( 3) and ( 4). Each column corresponds to a different Least Square estimated regression with fixed effects. The sample of countries is all non-OECD countries. In Columns ( 1) and ( 3) the weather station data are averaged using population weights. Columns ( 2) and ( 4) use area as weight.

       "  'Effects on international migration': 'Estimation of specification (9) requires correct identification of poor countries. To avoid setting an arbitrary threshold that separates poor from middle-income countries, whose responses differ in sign according to our model, we first let the data guide this choice. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 2 present the estimated effects of (the logarithm of) the temperature and precipitation on emigration rates interacted with dummies for different quartiles in the distribution of PPP-adjusted per capita GDP in 1990. The difference between the two columns is the weight we use to aggregate individual temperature observation based on population or area. The method of estimation is Least squares with fixed effects with standard errors clustered at the country-of-origin level. The estimated coefficients indicate large differences in the impact of temperature on migration along the income distribution, with a sign reversal between the first and second quartiles. The elasticities are negative for the first quartile, turn positive and large for the second and third quartiles and remain positive, though of a lower magnitude, for the top quartile. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 show the same estimates when the dependent variable is the rate of urbanization of a country (share of urban population). Changes in this rate are due to rural-to-urban migration and differential evolution of the population. Even in this case, we observe a significant and clear sign reversal of the effect between the first and second quartiles of the distribution. Hence, these results provide support towards the use of the first quartile of the income distribution as a reasonable definition of a poor country. Those countries are at the bottom of the GDP per capita distribution and their migration response to temperature is different from that of other countries and in line with the prediction of our model. We apply this definition throughout the paper and conduct robustness checks, modifying the value of the cut-off point around the 25th percentile.\\nIn a robustness check, presented in Table A1 in the Table Appendix, we conduct a similar exercise on a larger sample of countries by also including rich OECD countries as potential emigration countries. 10 Results are similar to those presented in Table 2 and they show, in addition, that in rich (OECD) countries, the effect of temperature on emigration and urbanization rates is small and usually not significantly different from zero. The null elasticity of migration to temperature in rich countries is consistent with the estimated effect working through agricultural income, which is important in poor and middle-income countries, and not through other omitted channels which may be important in rich countries. As in rich countries, agriculture represents only a small source of income and the rural population is a small percentage of the total, the impact of temperature on these countries can be seen as a further test on the validity of our assumption. The results presented are consistent with our assumption.\\nTable 3 presents the main estimated coefficients obtained from specification (9). Columns (1) to (4) show estimates in which we use population weights for the aggregation of weather station temperature and precipitation data, while Columns (5) and ( 6) aggregate temperature data using area weights. The estimated specifications in Columns (2) and ( 6) are exactly as shown in Eq. ( 10). In Columns (1) and ( 5) we omit the interaction of temperature with the \"poor country\" dummy to obtain the average effect of temperature on emigration, averaging all countries. In Columns (3) and ( 4) we also 10 Table A1 provides the same list of 30 poor countries as Table 2. The list of countries in the bottom income quintile of a distribution with OECD countries corresponds to the list of countries in the bottom income quartile of a distribution without OECD countries. Note: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of emigration rates. Each column corresponds to a different Least Square estimated regression with fixed effects. The sample of countries is all non-OECD countries. In Columns ( 1)-( 4) the weather station data are averaged using population weights. Columns ( 5)-( 6) use area as weight.

This dummy and its interaction with the logarithm of temperature is used in place of (Column (3)) or together with (Column (4)) the interaction of temperature with the \"poor country\" dummy. Agricultural prevalence should be an alternative to GDP per person to identify poor countries, and to single out those on which temperature may have a strong impact on productivity via its effect on agriculture. This is an important check, as we presume that agricultural productivity is the channel through which temperature affects migration. The number of observations is 115 over four decades, except when we include an interaction using the share of value-added in agriculture (Columns (3) and ( 4)), which reduces the number of observations significantly.\\nTwo results emerge from Table 3 that are consistent with our model predictions and robust across different specifications. First, not including the interaction with the \"poor country\" dummy, Column (1) displays a non-significant effect of the average temperature on emigration rates for the full sample of poor and middle-income countries. Similarly, no significant effect is found on the precipitation variable. The second result, however, is when we allow the coefficient of the temperature variable to vary between middle-income and poor countries (as we do in Column 2 and beyond) by adding an interaction with the \"Poor country\" dummy. The coefficient on temperature in middle-income countries (c) turns positive and statistically significant at the 5% confidence level, while the coefficient of the interaction between the \"poor country\" dummy and the temperature (c P ) becomes negative, quite large in absolute value, and significant at the 1% level. The net effect of temperature on emigration in poor countries, obtained by adding c and c P and reported in the secondto-last row of Table 3, is also negative and statistically significant. 11 11 As described earlier, the \"poor country\" dummy identifies countries in the bottom of the country-of-origin income per capita distribution. This includes countries with income per person below $1500 in 1990 as \"poor\".\\nThe estimated coefficients in Column ( 2) indicate that a one percent increase in temperature increases international migration rates by 4% in middle-income countries, whereas it decreases emigration rates in poor countries by 16%, ceteris paribus. This implies a middleincome country with an average yearly temperature of 22 • C(the average of our sample) would experience a 20% increase in the rate of emigration if its average yearly temperature increased by 1 • (roughly a 5% increase). Hence, at the average, this will imply an increase of the emigration rate from 0.042 to 0.05, with a 0.8 percentage point higher emigration rate. The same one degree Celsius warming in a poor country, however, would generate an 80% decrease in the rate of emigration (from 0.018 to 0.004). This seems a significant but reasonable impact. The only previous study that allows a comparison of magnitude for this effect is Cai et al. (2014). In that study the basic specification (in their Table 2 Column (2)) finds that an increase in temperature equal to one degree centigrade produces an increase in emigration rates to the average destination (and hence overall) by about 0.047 log points (i.e. 4.7%). This is an elasticity of the effect within one year. Our ten year elasticity for middle-income countries is four time larger (20%), while for low income countries we obtain a negative elasticity. As emphasized above, Cai et al. (2014) use gross rates and do not differentiate a response between poor countries and middle-income ones, although the countries with large agricultural shares that they include are likely relatively poor.\\nThe coefficients on the variable \"Precipitation\" (d) and Precipitation interacted with the \"poor country\" dummy (d P ) are not statistically significant in most cases. We do not detect a comparable effect of precipitation on migration. Several other studies find small or non-significant effect of rainfall or flooding on the probability of migrating (e.g. Auffhammer and Vincent, 2012;Bohra-Mishra et al., 2014;Mueller et al., 2014) . We inquire further into this relationship by including only the precipitation variable in the regression, as warming can be related to increased probability of drought and act as a confounding factor. The estimates, reported in Table A2 of the Table Appendix, show no significant correlation between precipitation and migration even when the variable \"temperature\" is omitted. Using Note: The dependent variable is natural logarithm of emigration rates. Each column corresponds to a different Least Square estimated regression with fixed effects. The sample of countries is all non-OECD countries. In Columns ( 1)-( 4) the weather station data are averaged using population weights. Columns ( 5)-( 8) use area as weight. The number of poor countries in Columns (1) and ( 5) is 34, in Columns ( 2) and ( 6) is 36, in Columns ( 3) and ( 7) is 24 and in Columns ( 4) and ( 8) is 18. The standard errors are cluster by country of origin.\\n* Indicates significance at the 10% confidence level. * * Indicates significance at the 5% confidence level. * * * Indicates significance at the 1% confidence level.\\nspecifications similar to those of Table 3, in fact, we observe that the estimated coefficient on the precipitation variable is never significant. According to these results, agriculture-related emigration seems mainly due to changes in temperature, rather than changes in precipitations.\\nIf the negative effect on migration in poor countries proceeds from lower agricultural productivity and liquidity constraints, as assumed by our simple model, then it should be particularly strong for countries heavily depending on agriculture. The share of agriculture in GDP and the income per person generally display a strong negative correlation, so that poor countries have, in general, a larger share of agricultural value-added in GDP. For this reason we explicitly include a dummy in Column (3) capturing those countries with a large agricultural sector. Their productivity and income are likely to be more affected by warming temperatures. We compute a dummy for a country being \"prevalently agricultural\", which is equal to one if a country belongs to the top quartile in the world distribution of agriculture as a share of GDP. 12 Columns (3) and (4) add interactions between temperature/precipitation and the agricultural dummy to specification (10). The coefficients of the temperature-agricultural interaction are negative and statistically significant when included instead of the interactions with \"poor\" (Column (3)) and even when included in addition to those variables (in Column ( 4)). In particular, conditional on a country being poor, an increase in average temperature by 1% (about 0.2 • C at the sample average) decreases the rate of emigration by an additional 12% if the country is also highly agricultural-dependent. When included together, the \"poor country\" and \"prevalently agricultural\" dummies interacted with the temperature have similar coefficients. Finally, notice that different weighting of the temperature data do not make much of a difference in the estimates (Columns ( 5) and ( 6)).\\n12 As in the case of GDP per capita, the choice of the year for drawing the distribution was determined by the availability of data. For the agricultural share the year 2000 was chosen.\\nIn a robustness check we use a different sample of poor and middle-income countries (Table A3). Rather than excluding OECD countries, we drop from the sample those countries in the top quintile of the income per person distribution. The dummy for \"poor\" countries is equal to one for countries in the bottom quintile of the income distribution determined before excluding rich countries. The empirical estimates indicate that the main findings are robust not only to a different weighting but also to a different definition of our sample (non-OECD versus countries below the top quintile of GDP per person). Hence, we will mostly use the non-OECD definition of poor and middle-income countries and the population weights.\\nIn Table 4 we present robustness checks around the cut-off income between poor and middle-income countries. Using the bottom quartile as a benchmark, as done in Table 3, resulted in 30 countries being counted as poor. In Table 4 we increase(decrease) the number of poor countries by increasing (decreasing) by 10 and 20% the income threshold. In both cases the significant change in magnitude and sign of the effect of temperature on migration is confirmed. The change in the impact is not linked to the behavior of few countries near the threshold.\\nIn Table 5 we present some robustness checks on possible nonlinearity in the effect of temperature on migration. The existing literature (Burke et al., 2015;IPCC, 2014;Mendelsohn et al., 1994) argues that the relationship between temperature and productivity is non-linear. Increases in temperature are more damaging for agricultural output above a certain value, which can be set around 20/25 • . Therefore, the change in the marginal effect between poor and middle-income countries, that we find, could be an artifact of this non-linearity rather than a differential response of migration to changes in productivity that affects both poor and middle-income countries. If poor countries start with higher temperature than middle-income countries, then differing impacts of temperature on migration could be simply explained by this non-linear productivity effect, even without any liquidity constraint effect. To test this hypothesis we add squared terms of temperature and precipitation in the sample of non-OECD countries, without interaction for poor countries. Column (1) of Table 5 presents the estimated coefficients. Note: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of emigration rates. Each column corresponds to a different Least Square estimated regression with fixed effects. The sample of countries for Column ( 1) is all non-OECD countries. Columns (2)-( 3) are non-OECD countries, excluding those in the bottom quartile of GDP per capita distribution. Columns (4)-( 5) use non-OECD countries in the bottom quartile of the per-capita GDP distribution. The standard errors are cluster by country of origin. * Indicates significance at the 10% confidence level. ** Indicates significance at the 5% confidence level. *** Indicates significance at the 1% confidence level.\\nThe coefficients of the squared terms are not statistically significant suggesting that a simple non-linearity in temperature would not capture the change in marginal impacts on migration.\\nThen, in Columns (2) to (5) we split the sample and analyze the effects of temperature and precipitation on emigration for middleincome and poor countries separately. We therefore allow all the coefficients in our model (not only those on average temperature) to differ between these two groups of countries. The stratification of our sample implies Columns (2) and (3) estimate the effect on middleincome countries, while Columns (4) and ( 5) estimate the effect on poor countries. The point estimates in Columns ( 2) and (4) are in line with the corresponding coefficients presented in Table 3. An increase in temperature by 1% in middle-income countries increases emigration rates by about 4%. The same average temperature increase in poor countries decreases emigration rates by about 22%. The precipitation variable does not appear to have any significant effect on either group. The opposite effects of temperature on the emigration rate in poor and middle-income countries are consistent with the model presented in Section 3 and with a standard economic logic that emphasizes the presence of both incentives and constraints. If secular heating damages agricultural productivity, countries with a large dependence on agriculture and a very low income experience a substantial worsening of their liquidity and hence their ability to pay for emigration. On the other hand, middle-income countries experience a worsening of potential earnings, increasing people\\'s willingness to emigrate as long as they can afford to do so. The finding is clearly related to the widespread regularity (summarized, for instance, in Clemens, 2014) that emigration rates have a humpshaped relation with income per person in the country-of-origin. An income increase in very poor countries allows them to pay the cost of emigration, increasing the rate of emigration. Past a certain level, however, higher income reduces the incentives to migrate. Most studies find the inversion of this relation takes place between $3000 and $5000 per person, a level in the low range of the middle-income countries in our sample. Hence, consistently with that literature, the negative effect we find on poor countries could be fully due to the worsening of income and liquidity constraints.\\nAs an additional robustness check, in Columns (3) and ( 5) we present the estimated effects of temperature and precipitation on emigration rates for different quartiles of the temperature and precipitation distributions, measured in year 1970. In this way we analyzed if being in higher temperature quartiles strengthens the impact within income group. If our liquidity-incentive story is correct, we should find a positive impact of temperature on migration in most middle-income countries, and possibly stronger (positive) effects for those in the hottest (top quartile) part of the temperature distribution. Conversely, we should find a negative effect in all poor countries, and potentially larger (in absolute value) in the hottest countries. The results confirm these expectations, with the exception of a positive coefficient in the third temperature quartile for poor countries, likely driven by a few outliers. We find positive effects of temperature on migration in middle-income countries, and Note: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of emigration rates. Each column corresponds to a different Least Square estimated regression with fixed effects. The sample for columns is all non-OECD countries. In Columns ( 1) to (3) the \"Extreme temperature\" variable is defined as the number of years in a decade in which the temperature was above or below two standard deviations of the 1960-2000 period mean for the country. In Columns ( 4) to ( 6) only the episodes of temperature above the average plus two standard deviations are included in the definition of \"Extreme temperature\". The weather station data are averaged using population weights. The standard errors are cluster by country of origin.\\n* Indicates significance at the 10% confidence level. * * Indicates significance at the 5% confidence level. * * * Indicates significance at the 1% confidence level. most significant (but not larger in point estimates) for hot countries, and mainly negative effects for poor countries, stronger for the hottest. 13The nonlinear effect of temperature can be further scrutinized by adding a variable that captures the realization of extreme temperatures during a decade in a country. We computed a variable that measures the number of years of a decade in which the temperature was above or below two standard deviations from the 1960-2000 period mean for the country. According to the variable, temperature anomalies, both above and below the mean, have been more likely in the most recent decades. The occurrence of one extreme episode in the decade was registered 117 times. Out of these, 58 cases happened between 1990Out of these, 58 cases happened between and 2000Out of these, 58 cases happened between , 21 between 1990Out of these, 58 cases happened between and 1980Out of these, 58 cases happened between , 23 between 1970Out of these, 58 cases happened between and 1980Out of these, 58 cases happened between and 15 between 1960Out of these, 58 cases happened between and 1970. . For some countries, these temperature anomalies have occurred twice and three times within a single decade, but these occurrences were rather rare. We added to the basic specification the count of the extreme temperature events per decade, as well as its interaction with the \"poor country\" dummy variable. Columns (1) and (3) of Table 6 show that emigration rates in middle-income countries are not influenced by the occurrence of temperature anomalies, nor do they matter for migration in poor countries, regardless of the specification of countries we use. Columns (4) to (6) focus specifically on extremely high temperature years (only anomalies in the high temperature range), yet we do not find significant effects of those episodes while we still find the negative and significant effect on Poor countries of the increase in average temperature.\\nIn Tables A4 andA5 of the Table Appendix we explore two further robustness checks. In Table A4 we consider decade differences in emigration rates and temperature (rather than their level) and we omit the country fixed effects in the panel. The estimated effects of temperature and its interaction with the \"poor\" dummy are somewhat attenuated relative to the estimates in levels, as it happens when differencing increases the noise-to-signal ratio. However, the positive impact on middle-income countries is still significant and the estimated coefficient on \"poor countries\" is still negative and large (although not significant). Table A5, instead, shows the results of a \"long-difference\" estimation. In this case we take differences (between temperature and emigration rates) over thirty years -between the seventies and nineties -and we estimate a cross-sectional regression for these long (thirty years) differences. Comparing the long-run estimates of Table A5 and the corresponding medium-run coefficients of Table 3 we see that elasticities are even larger in the first case. This suggests that persistent episodes of temperature increase have even stronger effects on the very long-run propensity to migrate, especially in poor countries. This may imply that, by worsening income perspectives in rural areas, an increase in average temperature may have damaging effects on income that amplify with time as the possibility of emigration becomes ever more remote. Overall, the pattern emerging consistently across specifications is that increased temperature encourages emigration in middle-income countries, but reduces it in poor countries. This effect is significant and for poor countries it may imply, especially in the long-run, a reduced ability of people to emigrate and escape poverty.',\n",
       "  'Effects on urbanization': 'International migration is certainly a way to take advantage of economic opportunities and is also a way to escape local rural poverty. However, most of the population does not migrate internationally because of high costs, lack of information and limited opportunities (e.g. Pritchett, 2006). Internal migration, especially from rural areas to urban areas is a very important alternative for most of the population. While the economic returns to internal migration are lower, such a move is less costly than emigration. The same ideas, developed in the model of Section 3, can be applied to rural-urban migrants. Increased temperature will affect agriculture productivity more than urban activities and, thus, will mainly affect the income of rural populations. Moreover, the returns to skills are likely to be larger in the city than in the countryside (as the model postulates). In very poor countries, the rural population may be so poor that it lacks the income to overcome the information and cost barriers for migrating to the city. This may actually be the main obstacle preventing migration in poor countries. Hence, a decrease in current income would make the transition to cities even less likely. In middle-income countries, instead, liquidity constraints may be less severe for rural workers, and so a worsening of the income perspectives in agriculture may increase inflows into cities. we can use a measure of \"urbanization\" as the outcome of interest, namely the share of a country\\'s total population living in cities.\\nThe change in this variable combines the effect of rural-urban migration with the effect of differential population changes due to mortality and nativity in cities and rural areas. Recent research emphasizes that during the most recent decades the largest part (around two-thirds) of the change in urbanization rates in developing countries is driven by rural-urban migration, while the rest may be due to differential population growth. Jedwab et al. (2014) find that, despite a nontrivial contribution by natural population change, the largest part of increased urbanization in middle-income and poor countries is linked to rural-urban migration. Drawing on this literature, in this analysis we take the measure of urbanization rates and their changes as proxies for the net rural-to-urban migration inside each country. We analyze the effects of increasing average temperature and precipitation on urbanization, just as we did for international migration rates. The structure of Table 7 follows exactly that of Table 3, except that the outcome variable is the share of population living in urban areas relative to total population in the country (also called the urbanization rate). Columns ( 1) and ( 4) use the average country temperature calculated by using population weights, while Columns ( 5) and ( 6) use area weights. The results in Columns ( 1) and ( 2) suggest a response of rural-urban migration to temperature similar to that of international migration. Namely, an increase in the average temperature increases the degree of urbanization, speeding up the rural-urban transition in middle-income countries, but slows such migration down in poor countries. A 5% increase in temperature at the average (22 • C), which is equal to about 1 • C, increases urbanization rates by 4 percentage points in middle-income countries, while it decreases it by the same amount in poor countries. Considering that poor countries have an average urbanization rate of around 19% in this period, and the increase in urbanization was about 20 percentage points per decade over the considered period, an increase in temperature by 1 • C may slow the urbanization process very significantly. As in the case of international migration, precipitation does not appear to have a significant effect on urbanization. To the contrary, the interaction between precipitation and the \"poor country\" dummy has a marginally significant effect. This effect, however, is not robust and only significant at the 10% level, so we do not think it is evidence of an additional productivity effect. In Column (3) we confirm that the negative effect of temperature on rural-urban migration exists on \"prevalently agricultural\" countries (as much as on \"poor\" countries), but Column (4) shows that when we include both interactions, only the one with \"poor\" remains significant.\\nThe use of area weights (Columns ( 5) and ( 6) of Table 7) or the use of a different sample of poor and middle-income countries, which comprise countries in the bottom and fourth quintiles of GDP per person rather than non-OECD countries (Columns (3) and ( 4) of Table A3 of the Table Appendix) leaves the findings unchanged. As already shown in Table 2, it seems reasonable to consider the \"cut-off\" between poor and middle-income countries at the twentyfifth percentile of the GDP per capita distribution. The impact of Note: The dependent variable is the urban population as a share of the total population. Each column corresponds to a different Least Square estimated regression with fixed effects.

Such a cut-off also works well for rural-to-urban migration, as shown in Columns ( 3) and ( 4) of Table 2. The different behavior of the poor countries in terms of migration response to temperature is also shown in Table A1 of the Table Appendix, in which all countries of origin are included (not just poor and middle-income). That table shows that the effect of warming temperature on rich countries\\' migration (now the top quintile) is still small, while poor countries -the bottom quintile of the distribution -still exhibit a negative response.\\nSome studies (e.g. Marchiori et al., 2012) postulate a direct connection between rural-urban migration and international migration. Namely, they consider rural populations affected by weather shocks as first moving into cities, increasing urbanization rates and crowding urban centers. International migration proceeds as a consequence of this crowding, which produces a decrease in income and/or of amenities in cities. This is a reasonable possibility and our results are consistent with it. However, rural populations may directly migrate abroad. Moreover, the crowding of cities may decrease income, through crowding, or increase it, through agglomeration, so that international migration may not be a direct consequence of urbanization. In our framework, we consider urbanization and international migration as two possible outcomes driven by a decline in rural income, but not necessarily sequentially or linked. Individuals in rural areas are more affected by temperature and, hence, their migration behavior to cities or abroad could be affected. The results from Table 7, overall, suggest increases in temperature have similar effects on rural-urban migration as on international emigration, strengthening the plausibility of our interpretation.',\n",
       "  'Where do people migrate in response to warming?': 'Are rich and far away countries the main destination for people who move out of middle-income countries as a consequence of warming and lower agricultural productivity? Or are these individuals prevalently moving to nearby countries that are experiencing better economic opportunities? Does warming produce a large scale movement of individuals from middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to rich countries in Europe and North America? Or does it produce a more local reallocation across middleincome countries within a region? In order to analyze this question, we compute the net emigration rates for each country of our sample, separating emigrants to OECD and non-OECD countries. Columns (1) to (4) of Table 8 present the findings using this split. We then separate emigration between destinations within 1000 km from the origin and farther destinations and we calculate separate rates for short-distance and long-distance emigrations. Columns (5) to (8) of Table 8 show the estimates in this case.\\nThe estimates show a very interesting pattern for the temperature-induced emigration. Columns (1) and (2) show the effect on emigration rates towards non-OECD destinations. Columns (3) and (4) show the impact on emigration rates to OECD destinations. Inclusion of the interaction between temperature and the poor-country dummy varies by column. Two findings are worth discussing. First, a warming climate increases emigration rates from middle-income countries only to non-OECD destinations. It has no significant effect on emigration to OECD countries. This result is consistent with our proposed channel, as emigration is driven by a worsening of local opportunities and not by an increase in opportunities in rich countries. Hence, migrants move to where they have better chances of finding a job given their current constraints. This \"push\" factor (decreased rural income) increases migration to similar economies rather than to OECD economies. On the other hand, the immigration-reducing effect for poor countries (due to worsening opportunities) affects both types of destinations, as potential emigrants become less likely to leave the country.\\nSimilarly and consistently, higher temperatures increase emigration rates to close destinations ( <1000 km) for middle-income countries (Column (6)), while poor countries experience a decrease of emigration rates to any other country (Columns ( 6) and ( 8)). The standard error on the estimated effects in Column (6) are rather large, however. Combining the effect on poor and middle-income countries, it appears that increases in average temperature may actually decrease overall emigration to OECD countries. Middle-income countries are not more likely to experience emigration towards those destinations, while poor countries experience a reduction in emigration rates. This is bad news for the potential income of individuals from non-OECD countries, for which emigration to rich countries constitutes one of the best options for increasing household income and economic well-being. 14',\n",
       "  'Robustness checks': 'We conducted a variety of robustness checks and present the results in the Table Appendix. However, we will summarize them here. First, we have focused our attention on countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This specific group includes most of the poor countries in our sample as well as those whose productivity is likely to be strongly affected temperature increases. Moreover, several of the previous studies (e.g. Barrios et al., 2006 andMarchiori et al., 2012) have considered only Sub-Saharan African Countries in their analysis of extreme weather events and migration. In Column (1) of Table A6 we have included a dummy, \"SSA\", in the place of \"poor\" and an interaction term between temperature (and precipitation) and the \"SSA\" dummy. In Column (2) we have included both the SSA and the \"poor country\" dummy, as well as their interactions. Columns ( 1) and ( 2) analyze the effect on emigration rates, while Columns (3) and (4) look at the impact on urbanization rates. A variety of interesting results emerge, mostly confirming the previous ones. First, temperature has a negative impact on emigration out of SSA countries and is mainly due to them being poor and primarily rural countries. In Column (1) the interaction is negative and significant, while in Column (2) we find no difference for Sub-Saharan Africa once we allow for a different coefficient on poor countries. Hence, our analysis shows that SSA countries\\' migration response to temperature increase looks in line with the response for other poor countries. A hotter climate reduces the ability of rural populations to migrate.\\nA second effect, however, is now estimated as significant and is consistent with the temperature effect. That is the effect of precipitation. Drier climates are associated with higher emigration rates for non-SSA countries and lower emigration-rates for SSA countries. These effects are significant and are robust to the inclusion of the \"poor\" dummy interactions, revealing a role for precipitation as a driver of agricultural productivity in SSA. This may be due to the fact that SSA countries are more affected by drier climate because of their rural nature, or that investments in irrigation are rare among farm households in this area of the world. Moreover, this finding indicates that some regions of frequent droughts (e.g., East Africa) are extremely dependent on seasonal water. A decline in precipitation and an increase in temperature (both of which would be associated with lower agricultural productivity in this region) will drive lower emigration, leaving people in a worsening condition of poverty. Once we allow for this effect in SSA countries, higher temperature and lower precipitation push emigration from the other countries that are not as poor. So, in line with their extreme poverty and dependence on agriculture, as well as consistent with the fact that emigration rates out of SSA countries are rather low, worsening agricultural productivity due to warmer and drier weather reduces rural-urban migration and emigration from Sub-Saharan Africa.\\nWe conducted an additional robustness check. Given that climate change is expected to bring an intensification of natural disasters, such as droughts; floods; storms; and extreme heat, we count the total number of natural disasters in each specific decade computed from the International Disaster Database (Guha-Sapir et al., 2015). In Table A7 we added this variable along with its interaction with the \"poor country\" dummy variable. We find that emigration rates 14 In an alternative (unreported) way of testing the effect of warming on the destination distance, we have calculated the \"average distance\" of emigrants, where the weighted distance variable is given by: j dist ji * flows ji j flows ji ,where dist ji is the geographical distance between origin j and destination i. Increases in temperature significantly decrease the average distance of emigration from middle-income countries.\\nare not influenced by the occurrence of natural disasters. In further specifications (not reported, but available upon request) we have included each type of natural disaster; namely droughts, floods, storms, and extreme heat individually in the regression as the count of their occurrences in the decade. We do not find any impact. It is likely that natural disasters and rare weather events drive different types of migration, more akin to local mobility and potentially reversed in years of good weather. Natural disasters may be responsible for the displacement of people in near areas, generating nonpermanent transitions, but in the long run they may not significantly affect rural-urban and international migration when looking at all countries as they are rare and only occur in some countries. This finding is consistent with the analysis of Beine and Parsons (2015), who do not find a direct impact for the same type of events on bilateral migration, and with the analysis of Bohra-Mishra et al. (2014) for the migration behavior in Indonesian villages. This last paper finds a permanent migration response in Indonesia (a middle-income country) to long-run increases in temperature, but not to episodic disasters. Mueller et al. (2014) report that heat stress, but not flooding, has a significant effect on migration in Pakistan.\\nFinally, Table A8 specifies temperature in levels rather than logarithms. The estimated values are comparable to those obtained using the log specification. An increase in 1 • C would increase emigration rates by 27% in middle-income countries (using Column (2) coefficients) and decrease emigration rates by 86% in poor countries. This is similar to the main results reported in Table 3.',\n",
       "  'Effects on structural change and GDP': 'In the previous sections we have estimated a reduced-form relationship between temperature (and precipitation) and emigration/urbanization rates across countries. We have shown these correlations to be consistent with the following interpretation: increased temperatures decrease agricultural productivity and exacerbate the liquidity constraint for rural populations in poor countries, reducing their ability to emigrate. Instead, they increase incentives for rural populations in middle-income countries, increasing the probability to emigrate from these countries. Several checks confirmed this interpretation and the \"exogenous\" nature of temperature, and its variation across countries relative to local economic and social conditions ensure that reverse causality problems are limited.\\nWe postulated that agricultural productivity is the pathway that links temperature and migration. However, one could argue that higher temperatures have other disruptive effects in poor countries besides their impact on agriculture (increased conflict, wars, effects on health and fertility) that also reduce emigration rates. Admitting it is hard to identify those channels fully and precisely, we want to emphasize the agricultural productivity channel. Hence, we will test several other plausible implications derived from our model in which migration response (or lack of it) is prevalently linked to rural income (agricultural productivity).\\nHigher temperature influences emigration rates by lowering agricultural productivity both in poor and middle-income countries. While in middle-income countries lower agricultural productivity translates into higher emigration rates, and hence a further reduction in agricultural value-added, the existence of liquidity constraints in poor countries implies that lower agricultural productivity prevents people from leaving and, hence, this second channel of potential decline in agriculture value-added as a share of GDP is muted. This implies higher temperature should have a negative impact on valueadded in agriculture as a share of GDP, and this effect should be particularly strong in middle-income countries in which emigration also causes a decline in the number of agricultural workers. To test this hypothesis, we regress a reduced-form relationship between temperature and agricultural value-added as a percent of GDP and show the coefficient estimates in Table 9. As before, we consider only middle-income and poor countries and obtain the data on value-added in agriculture as a share of GDP from the World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2015). In line with expectations, increases in temperature significantly decrease the agricultural share of GDP for middle-income countries (Column (2)). However, for poor countries the effect is more imprecisely estimated and is not significantly different from zero (although positive in point estimate; see the last row of the table). This consistent with the idea that in middle-income countries the direct effect of warming (producing a decrease in agricultural productivity) and the indirect effect (inducing migration of rural population to cities or abroad) both contribute to reduced value-added in agriculture. In poor countries, to the contrary, only the direct effect is present and in aggregate may be less significant. Therefore, lower agricultural productivity because of higher temperatures, combined with the possibility of migrating (to cities or abroad) may simply speed up the structural transformation of some middle-income countries away from rural economies towards more urban and productive economies. Though, in very poor countries where migration mechanisms do not work, the loss in agricultural productivity does not trigger a structural change from rural to urban economies.\\nThe previous channel, operating through a structural transformation, encouraged or slowed by warming, suggests another implication of our theory. Warming could be associated with an increase in GDP per capita in middle-income countries where rural workers move to more productive cities. Instead, it should be associated with a decrease of GDP per capita in poor countries where rural workers are stuck in an impoverished agricultural sector. We test this implication in Table A9 of the Table Appendix in which the dependent variable is the logarithm of GDP per capita, obtained from the Penn World Table (2009) in Columns ( 1) and ( 2) or from the World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2015) in Columns ( 3) and ( 4). Consistently with these predictions, middle-income countries experience growth in GDP per person (Columns (2) and ( 4)). The mobility of workers into cities (with higher productivity potential) and the out-migration of poor rural workers result in a positive effect, significant at the 5% level, of between 1.9 and 2.2. To the contrary, poor countries experience a negative impact of higher temperature on income per person, with an interaction term that is negative and significant.\\nOverall, warming temperature increases GDP per capita in middle-income countries while negatively affecting GDP per capita in poor countries. This result confirms what was already found by Burke et al. (2015) and Dell et al. (2012) and hence is not new. Our framework, however, provides an additional explanation, linked crucially to the role of mobility/migration as a margin of adjustment to these weather shocks. In countries in which agricultural productivity is not so low as to be at subsistence level, a worsening of economic opportunities in agriculture pushes individuals to migrate to cities and to other countries, opening them up to better opportunities and eventually helping to raise the average income of a country. Urbanization and moving out of agriculture are crucial mechanisms to the increase of GDP, and in countries at middle-income levels, warming can be an additional push to realize the gains from urbanization. However, in places in which agricultural productivity is so low as to leave rural populations liquidity constrained and stuck to agriculture, a warming climate and lower agricultural productivity may slow economic transformation and growth. These effects ultimately contribute to a poverty trap.',\n",
       "  'Discussion and conclusions': 'In this paper we have focused on the potential impact that the increase in average temperature, experienced in many countries during the last few decades, may have on internal and international migration. We have assumed the main impact of temperature increase is through an effect on agricultural productivity and, hence, countries experiencing larger increases may have suffered declining agricultural productivity. This channel, which should mainly affect rural populations, has differential consequences on emigration rates depending on the income level of potential migrants. In very poor countries, where the main obstacle to migration is that people are so poor they cannot afford the cost of emigration, warming and lower rural income may imply less emigration. That is, rural populations go even deeper into poverty and subsistence mode as a consequence of low agricultural productivity. In countries where income is not as low, however, lower agricultural productivity will enhance the incentives to migrate either to cities or abroad. Consistent with these predictions, we find climatic warming associated with significantly higher emigration rates in middle-income countries and significantly lower rates in poor countries (income per capita lower than 1500 $ per person, which includes many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa). We also show that, as a consequence of the migration out of rural poverty encouraged by warming, middle-income countries are better off in terms of their GDP per capita. Poor countries, to the contrary, are made worse off and may be further trapped in poverty as a consequence of climatic warming.

(2011) and include matrices of bilateral migrant stocks in five available census years spanning 1960-2000, for 226 countries of origin and 226 countries of destination. To compute the emigration rates used in the estimations, first we compute bilateral emigration net flows as differences between bilateral stocks in two consecutive censuses. Then we sum all bilateral flows for the same countries of origin j, setting negative values to 0, as they are likely be due to mortality of the stock of emigrants abroad. The emigration rate from country of origin j is the ratio between the aggregated net flows from origin country j and the origin country population at the beginning of the decade. The computed emigration rates span the period from 1970 to 2000. The temperature and precipitation data are taken from Dell et al. (2012). The (terrestrial) monthly mean temperature and precipitation data at 0.5 × 0.5 degree resolution obtained from weather stations (Matsuura and Willmott, 2007) are aggregated into country-year averages using the population in 1990 at 30 arc second resolution as weights or alternatively using area weights. By merging the two datasets and considering only \"Poor and Middleincome\" countries, we were able to compile final datasets with 114 and 115 countries. The exact number depends on the weights used to aggregate the weather station data (population or area). Given that the emigration rates were only available at decade level, temperature and precipitation have been averaged over the 10 years of the decade.

       " 7: {'abstract': 'Internal migration in rural Benin is not directed to the southern coastal regions as in many neighbouring countries. Instead, peasants from the densely populated and environmentally critical northwest of Benin are engaging in a process of agricultural colonization of the central region. Consequently, the predominant approach to understanding these processes of internal population movement in Benin is to focus on environmental degradation. But why do people stay in degraded areas while others leave? Why do migrants again leave the environmentally still stable destination areas and why does migration itself becomes causation for new migration? It is obvious that one needs a structural understanding of the environment in the political and cultural context of this region to understand its role as a driver for migration. On the basis of an empirical case-study the impact of progressive deterioration of environmental conditions is embedded in social and cultural structures. Being aware of this is necessary in order to really understand a migration pattern that at first glance could be misconstrued as being purely environmentally induced. Since migration theories are somehow overlooked in the debate on environment and forced migration the empirical findings will be embedded in a theoretical approach that places greater emphasis on a cumulative causation of migration and on the inter-temporal dimension of migration.',\n",
       "  \"''ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEE'': A CONTESTED CONCEPT AND ITS APPLICATION IN WEST AFRICA\": \"To identify the environmental refugee concept as highly problematic is nothing really new or innovative. Since the introduction of the term ''environmental refugees'' by El-Hinnawi in 1985, various authors (Kibreab, 1997;Black, 2001;Flintan, 2001;Castles, 2002) have written critical responses to the neo-malthusian-inspired model of environmental scarcity and forced migration by Homer-Dixon (1994) which mostly lacked empirical evidence or to the writings of Myers (1993;1997;2002) who predicts 200 million environmental refugees for the near future. This estimation exceeds by far the 10 million environmental refugees claimed by Jacobson (1988) for the end of the 1980s.\\nAt large, the critique could be summarized in the following three points.\\nTerminological ambiguity: despite various attempts (Myers andKent, 1995, Bates, 2002) the term itself remains poorly defined, thus making it extremely difficult to decide who could be classified as an environmental refugee. Attempts to overcome this deficit by using a less biased terminology such as ecological and environmental migrants (Wood, 2001) or distinguishing between environmentally motivated migrants, environmentally forced migrants and environmental refugees (Renaud, et al., 2007) may be useful for policy action. But given the seamless transitions between ''motivated'' and ''forced'', this does not offer a convincing solution for the conceptual and theoretical problems.\\nShortcomings in content: The core of the problems mentioned above is that most migration has manifold, interrelated and complex causes. It thus seems analytically impossible to identify a migration stream as principally environmentally-induced (with the exception of flight as direct responses to natural disasters or industrial accidents). In most cases only through simplifications can environmental factors be identified as root causes for population displacement. However, there is a good reason for the multitude of approaches in migration theory given the multitude of (political, economic and social) reasons for and the various forms and courses of migration.\\nPolitical instrumentalization: Even if it is very doubtful that the concept of environmental refugee is the result of a coordinated strategy of policy-makers in the industrialised world in order to depoliticise interna-tional migration and to get rid of the obligation to provide asylum, as Kibreab (1997) argued, it is astonishing that such an analytically weak concept is so prominent on the agendas of various organisations as the UNEP, IPCC and UNU that are very powerful in setting the international discourse. It would be an interesting challenge in the future, especially with regard to climate change (Piguet, 2008), to analyse this discourse in order to reconstruct the internal logic of agenda-setting in international organisations as McNamara ( 2007) attempted for the UN en bloc.\\nFocusing on Africa, it quickly becomes very clear that the continent and particularly the West African Sahel are favoured playgrounds for the protagonists of the environmental refugee concept (Jacobson, 1988;Richter, 2000;Hammer, 2004). In particular, Hammer seems to handle figures quite recklessly when he argues that ''hundreds of thousands of people from rural Sahel regions are displaced every year as a consequence of environmental change and desertification' ' (2004: 234). One has to be sceptical whether such claims could advance the debate, especially compared to studies that apply migration theories empirically using comprehensible methods and own data. Henry, et al. (2003), for example, used multivariate statistics coming to the conclusion that environmental variables can only explain 5 per cent of internal migrations in Burkina Faso. Findley (1994) argued very early that migration from Mali during the droughts of the 1980s declined instead of increased and explained this by pointing to the drought related lack of financial means for migration. Several studies, especially those using a sustainable livelihood approach, confirm the function of seasonal and circular migration as a well-established adaptive strategy rather than a knee-jerk and irreversible response to environmental stress (Conde´, et al., 1986;Fall, 1998;De Haan, 1999;De Haan and Rogaly, 2002). Furthermore recent empirical case studies from Ghana (Carr, 2005;van der Geest, 2008) provide an approach to place potential environmental drivers into a balanced framework of environmental, social and political factors for migrations decisions and show that it is structural resource scarcity rather than environmental degradation that leads to migration from the north to the south of Ghana.\\nHowever, be it Africa or any other region in the world, it is obvious that environmental change or degradation can contribute to migration just as the economic, demographic, political and social situation can do. Primary causes are difficult to identify. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the multiple factors causing a given migration stream in order to understand its internal logics and contextualise it theoretically as well as to formulate appropriate analyses enabling us to predict future migrations.\\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: After this introductory chapter the environmental refugee concept will be discussed in the context of migration theories. Against this background, I will then introduce my own approach as well as the related research questions before briefly introducing the regional context of population dynamics and environmental degradation in Benin. The next section presents the methodological approach. Analysing empirical findings addressing multiple reasons for multiple migrations, the paper ends with some concluding remarks placing the environment in migration.\",\n",
       "  'BRINGING THE SOCIAL BACK IN: THEORY, OBJECTIVE AND RESEARCH QUESTION': \"Environmentally-induced population movement is a certain kind of migration, thus it must remain open for embedding in migration theory instead of regarding it as a distinct phenomenon. The fact that migration theories are mostly masked out in the environmental refugee debate, points at potential reasons for the weak explanatory and predictive value of the term.\\nUnderstanding migration streams as environmentally determined, connotes a theoretical positioning within the bloc of classical approaches in migration theory since it conceptualises migration, in analogy to approaches that focus on labour markets and wage and income differentials of individuals and households (Todaro, 1980;Stark, 1991), as a process of equalisation between regions of deteriorating environmental conditions and areas where the state of the environment is better. Although these classical approaches are strong in revealing causation factors for and consequences of unidirectional migration, they broadly fail to explain why migration continues without spatial differences in wages and income or, to remain in the context, why environmental degradation in a certain region never leads to emigration of all inhabitants.\\nMigration therefore seems to be a selective process that could develop very different patterns at the same time and in the same place. For this reason, the internal dynamic of multidirectional migration and the formation of delocalised social phenomena has become the subject-matter of new theoretical approaches which focus on networks and social capital. But even if we have to consider social influences on migratory decisions to be more than an annoying ambient noise in modelling population movements, these new approaches should not be given the monopoly to explain migration. It is rather a question whether this rich theoretical pluralism can be utilised to formulate appropriate syntheses for empirical findings on migration that are neither under-nor oversocialised and meet the requirements which the cumulative causation of migration and its inter-temporal dimensions represent.\\nSo the purpose of this paper is to achieve a differentiated and reflexive embedding of environmentally induced migration motives in migration theory on the basis of an empirical case-study on the immigration of peasants from regions that are affected by soil degradation in the northwest of Benin to an area that was opened up for settlement through improvements of transportation infrastructure in the central region. In respect to the five groups of factors that Lonergan (1998) identified as environmental push elements that might lead to migration, it is the progressive deterioration of environmental conditions which are on one side linked to the probably ''most controversial type of environmental refugee'' (Bates, 2002: 475) but are by the same token much more frequent in West Africa compared to natural disasters, industrial accidents, environmental degradation related to conflict or development projects. Thus, the research question is: do soil degradation and its economic implications really constitute the most important motives for migration from the Northwest of Benin as the monocausal explanatory approaches of scientific work and studies of development projects and government agencies argue (Boni, 1995;Chabi, 1997;Edja, 1999;Igue´, 1983;MDR-ONASA, 2000;MCCAG-PD;Tche´gnon, 1995)?\",\n",
       "  'POPULATION DYNAMICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IN BENIN: THE CONTEXT': '',\n",
       "  'Demographic tendencies and migration in Benin': \"Three national censuses from 1979, 1992 and 2002 provide demographic data for Benin. In 2002, Benin had a total population of slightly more than 6,750,000 inhabitants (INSAE, 2003), with an average density of 60 inhabitants ⁄ km 2 and an annual growth rate of 3.25 per cent. However, these national demographic figures hide spatial disparities and dynamics on regional and local scales, especially between the north and south of the country. Since 1992, the annual demographic growth rate is slightly higher in comparison to only 2.8 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The fertility rate though in slight decline, is currently at 6.3 per cent and thus is still at a high level. As elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa fertility rates are decreasing much more significantly in the cities than in rural areas. Benin's population is very unevenly distributed. South Benin (238 inh. ⁄ km 2 ) has much higher population densities than central and north Benin (27 inh. ⁄ km 2 ), which in turn are partly characterized by higher growth rates.\\nIn central and north Benin, population density is below 70 inh. ⁄ km 2 throughout the region, with the exception of the district of Parakou. The lowest densities, with less than 10 inh. ⁄ km 2 , are observed in the northernmost district Karimara and westwards in Tanguie`ta, where settlement is restricted because of the large National parks. In contrast, the north western districts like Ouake´, Natitingou and Boukoumbe´have relatively high densities, but also low rates of increase (see Figure 1). Districts like Oue`sse, Bante`, Tchaourou and Bassila in central Benin have some of the highest demographic growth rates of the country. In Tchaourou, which had been the district with the lowest population density until the 1970s, growth rates have been consistently high for three decades, reaching 4.9 per cent per year. In Bassila, the strong increase of population growth has started more recently: here, the demographic growth has doubled since the 1980s, reaching 4.8 per cent in 2002. The exceptionally high growth rates in the central region are a result of internal migration flows in rural Benin that are not directed to the southern coastal regions as in many neighbouring countries. Farmers from Benin's densely-populated southern and north-western regions migrate to the historically low populated central region. The availability of land can be explained with the region's past function as buffer zone between the Wasangari of pre-colonial Borgou in the north, the powerful Dahomey kings in the South and Oyo-ruled lands in the east, as well as the slave roundups carried out until the end of the nineteenth century.\",\n",
       "  'Environmental degradation in northwest Benin': 'Since environmental degradation is always mentioned as the most important motive for migration from northwest Benin, general soil conditions and their individual limitations in particular will be outlined roughly within the following paragraphs. Especially the Atacora region and its surroundings are mentioned regularly as hotspots of soil degra-   top-soils due to hill-wash processes. As a result of strong hydrolytic alteration Cambisols, like most acidic soils in the tropics, show low contents of clay minerals, resulting in low cation exchange capacities (CEC). In turn these soils are typically poor in key nutrients.\\nThe natural vegetation has been partially destroyed or degraded to pyrophitic species due to frequent man-made bush fires and a characteristic slash and burn cultivation system. The thin humic top-soil layer of organic matter contains only residues of bush fires like charcoal and acid ash mixed with rare foliage of sclerophitic savanna species. Only in perennial cultures like local Teak plantations with a higher rate of primary production, a thicker mollic organic top-soil can accumulate.\\nDue to shortened or even completely eliminated fallow periods (<3 Y) and the low CECs, the amount of exchangeable soil nutrients in typical soils in North West Benin is very low (Landon, 1984: 113). Other studies of West African soils have shown C ⁄ N ratios in top-soils that are indicative of low amounts of nitrate (Faust, 1991;Meyer, 1992;Junge, 2004). As a result crop yields on those soils, in particularly on very poor sites on middle and hill-top positions, are very low.\\nIn addition to their naturally poor condition permanent soil cultivation caused by regional demographic growth and the resulting need to shorten traditional fallow periods have further decreased the soils crop potential and diminished their carrying capacity.',\n",
       "  'ASKING THE MIGRANTS: METHODS': \"The analysis is based on a combined quantitative-qualitative approach. Fieldwork was carried out between November 2000 and May 2005 in the area between Be´te´rou in the east and the western town of Bassila that remained largely untouched by migration until the second half of the 1990s, due to the absence of transportation infrastructure. Surveys were carried out in sixteen settlements whereby approximately half of all localities, old villages with allochthonous population and newly founded settlements of migrants, within the study area were covered. A total of 431 migrant households were surveyed using a partially standardised questionnaire. Additionally, 83 narrative and problem-oriented interviews were recorded, transliterated and analysed. About two-thirds of the survey was done by local research assistants (Beninese students) and three-quarters of the in-depth interviews were conducted with the assis- Questionnaire-based interviews as well as open interviews were conducted with heads of households at their new residence in the study area. The conceptual design of the questionnaire was geared to the recommendations of Bilsborrow (1984: 60ff.), and Standing (1984), as well as to a questionnaire that was applied in pilot study on migration of the National Institute of Statistics in Benin (INSAE, 1999). The questionnaire covered spatial and temporal criteria and served to identify selected characteristics of the interviewees: inter alia information on the context of origin, ethnic-linguistic affiliation, age structure, education, size of household, motives for and courses of migration and relations to the place of origin. This broad database particularly facilitated comparative statistical analysis of basic attributes of migrations on a macro level. As a first approach for a better understanding of migration motives, questions in this field were formulated in a relatively open manner, consequently there were no response categories. In order to evaluate the responses statistically they were summed up into groups of similar statements. Although this classification in categories is certainly subjective, it facilitates to access to the individual and instructive formulations in any phase of the analysis.\\nFor a deeper and more detailed understanding of migration motives and courses of migration the reductive analysis of questionnaire data, which must remain superficial to a certain extent, was completed by an explicative analysis of qualitative results whereas data collection was mainly structured by the interviewees. Narrative interviews were applied in the investigation of individual migrations courses and for the migrants' experiences at their different 'step stones'. Problem-oriented and focused interviews served primarily to check the assumptions on reasons for outmigration and factors of perpetuation of migration. The interpretation of transcripts resulted in the identification of similarities, types and structures which are justified through clarifying citations within the text.\\nSince only responsible heads of households were interviewed, it is solely about men with no women presiding over a household. This is mainly due to the cultivation of yam which is the principal source of income in that area and reserved for men. Hence, only the places of origin, the courses of migration and motives etc. of men were surveyed, which could certainly be different not only from the female ones but also from children or any other members of the household. Furthermore, it has to be assumed that the answers of the migrants in such an ex post reconstruction of motives are subject to an adaptation to cultural schemata and therefore to a certain homogenization. I will get back to this point in the discussion of the results.\",\n",
       "  'MULTIPLE REASONS FOR MULTIPLE MIGRATIONS': \"''La terrre est fatigue´e'' only? Fig. 2 shows the answers of the interviewed migrants concerning the question regarding the major problems in their home village. In order to get a general and subjective overview about the situation in the home villages this question was not explicitly related to migration on purpose. For reasons of clarity the data from the semi-structured questionnaire were summarised in thematic categories. A couple of quoted formulations from the questionnaire serve exemplarily for an explanation of theses categories.\\nAs one could have expected, negative appraisals of the conditions for agricultural production dominate. Soil degradation (39%; ''the soil is tired'', ''the soils have become fragile'') is by far the most frequently mentioned problem. One has to understand other problems like meagre harvests or work load in this context as well since they are consequences of declining soil fertility. Land scarcity (8%) means less an absolute shortage than a lack of fertile and profitable cultivation areas and can therefore be regarded as a consequence of soil degradation as well. Partial food insecurity (10%; ''it is difficult to live of our land'', ''I do not eat enough'') is a direct result of these problems.\\nAll in all, social conflicts (sorcery, family disputes and waste of money for expensive ceremonies) were mentioned in 8 per cent of the answers only. Lack of transportation infrastructure, insufficient accessibility to markets etc. were subsumed under ''others''. Four per cent of all interviewees declared not to see any problems.\\nThe answers to the question for the most important motives for leaving the home village (Fig. 3) give quite a differentiated picture of this migration stream. Obviously, the problems do not have to be categorically equivalent to the reasons for leaving. Whereas three quarters of the problems were related to the environmental conditions for agricultural production, only half of the motives are linked to this aspect whereby food insecurity (21%), soil degradation (13%), meagre harvests (8%) and land scarcity (4%) are mutually interdependent. The danger of sorcery and envy were mentioned many times more as a motive for departure than as a problem before (14%; ''I earned enough but people were jealous and threatened me'', ''The healers told me that the second wife of my father killed my 4 year old children. So I left the village''.). Unexplainable diseases (4%) (''I lost four children in my village and I don't know why'') could also be classified in this category. Internal family problems and disputes over expensive ceremonies were mentioned far more often as well. New motives are relative deprivation (''I left because I wanted to earn the same money the others do by migration.'') and the wish for economic independence (''If you are with your father you do not earn anything. It's all for him'').\\nThese results confirm clearly that beside environmental degradation, social structures and conflicts impact heavily on migration decisions. Given the interdependency between ecological crises and economic consequences on one side and social, cultural and political conditions on the other, it is very difficult to achieve a clear differentiation: ,,It must be recognized that the degradation of the environment is socially and politically constructed; only through a structural understanding of the environment in the broader political and cultural context of a region or country can one begin to understand its ''role'' as a factor in population movement'' (Lonergan, 1998: 12).\\nThe already mentioned potential adaptation to cultural schemata may also relativize the importance of environment induced migration motives. Since the study addresses peasants who live on the cultivation of land, land availability is the dominating subject on which one can draw in an interview in order to avoid talking about delicate and displeasing themes: ''I had to leave my village because my family had become a victim of sorcery. There are a lot of things that may people force to leave, but when they go they say it is because of the lack of cultivatable land'' (Interview with a migrant in the village of Samba, 2 October 2003, translated from French).\",\n",
       "  'Multidirectional migrations and networks': \"A remarkable result of the survey was that a majority of the interviewees (67%) did not come directly from their home villages to the study region but had already migrated several times during their life course. Focusing on the last residence (Fig. 1) reveals that the respondents moved mainly from the ''typical'' target regions of internal rural-rural migration to the study area. The districts involved are the cotton growing areas of Ndali, Bembe`re`ke`and Nikki, as well as regions of extraordinarily high food production like Oue`sse`, Bante`, Savalou, Save`and Tchaourou. This fact already indicates a much weaker importance of environment-induced migration motives. Soil degradation and related motives represent only 15 per cent of all answers and a new dominant motive appears instead (Fig. 4). For one-third of all migrants, conflicts with landowners were among the motives for leaving again. This category summarises quite different aspects like despotically fixed contributions (''We have been forced to give half of our harvest to the landowners'') or arbitrary withdrawals of provided cultivation areas (''Two times they took the parcel of land that I had cleared shortly before''). But already established migrants, too, were blamed for exploiting newcomers (''conflicts with other migrants'') as cheap or free labourers on their own fields.\\nHowever, numerous interviews confirm that legal uncertainty, especially regarding land tenure, appears to be the most important social driver for multiple migrations in rural Benin. In particular, in the already mentioned cotton growing areas the withdrawal of cultivated land is quite frequent. ''Initially we did not have any problems with them. But in our third year they began to take away our parcels of land. Me for example, I cultivated cotton and I took plenty of fertilisers on the field also in order to cultivate maize in the following year. The maize would have been benefited from the fertiliser. But then, after harvesting the cotton the landowners came and took it away in order to plant without any justification. It's a system you know?'' (Interview with a migrant in the village of Kpawa, 16 November 2003, translated from French).\\nBeside these new structural causation factors there is another important aspect that explains the perpetuation of migration in rural Benin although migrants did rarely mention it explicitly as a motive for migration: the importance of social networks and social capital. More than two-thirds (71%) mentioned to be related with at least one member of other migrant households in the new settlement. Barely half of all migrants had relatives in other settlements in the study area. Roughly two-thirds of the interviewees (63) stated that they visit the home village at least once per year and support the family at home by sending cash remittances or foodstuff; and half of the respondents indicated at least one person who plans to migrate to the study area. In some migrant villages there were family relations between roughly 80 per cent of all households. To have a relative or at least an acquaintance is an indispensable condition for being accepted in the new villages and chain migration is the dominating pattern of these migrations streams (Doevenspeck 2005: 151-162).\",\n",
       "  'PLACING ENVIRONMENT IN MIGRATION: CONCLUSION': 'The study has shown that spatial disparities with regard to the availability of non degraded and productive agricultural land alone could not explain internal migration in rural Benin. Problems of environmental degradation are similar in the entire northwest, but not all inhabitants migrate. A restriction on environmental degradation without taking into account social conditions is only of limited value for a deeper comprehension of rural-rural migration. Even the fact that people choose less populated regions with a higher agrarian potential is not an argument that backs a one-sided ecologic-demographic interpretation of these migration streams. Why should peasants migrate to areas with conditions even worse? However, environmental degradation certainly is part of the structural conditions within the contexts of origin. These structural conditions bring out migrations which are partly explainable with classical theoreti- cal approaches. At the same time the affected people perceive and cope with these conditions differently, whereby migration becomes a selective process, driven by factors on different levels (demography, economy, ecology, society). These factors interact, may accumulate, decrease or increase in importance as time goes by and maybe even be overlaid by completely new factors. Once the process of migration begins, mechanisms of social structuring bring about self-strengthening of migration, whereas the accumulation of drivers and its temporal and spatial variations contribute to its perpetuation. Drivers of migration may change during time and may be different for each single migration. At the same time drivers may be reproduced: Judex (2008) modelled land-use dynamics in the study area and could show that massive immigration of peasants leads to deforestation and decreasing soil fertility.\\nMigration itself causes and enforces social and economic change and brings about new migration as a consequence. Thus the unidirectional perspective is superseded by an analysis of transmigration. Related to this is the acknowledgment of social ties which contribute to the shaping and persistence of migration patterns. In consequence migration is neither an atomised phenomenon that can only be understood on the micro-level nor a sole result of macro-structural conditions.\\nWith regard to external intervention in general, and to development practice in particular, these results imply that migration will continue even if environmental degradation is stopped or reversed, and that migration can not be prevented totally, if this is desirable at all. This does not mean that efforts to battle the ecological crisis in the regions of origin should be abandoned. However, one important result of this study is that legal uncertainty, especially regarding land tenure, is one of the most important social drivers for multiple migrations. Thus, migrants should be given clear legal status in order to promote sustainable resource management and to avoid a perpetuation of environmental degradation in the target regions of internal rural-rural migration in Benin. This is, however, legally (land rights) and logistically challenging.'},\n",
       " 8: {'abstract': 'The concept of Environmental Migration has been broadly discussed by the international scientific community. Especially developing countries will have to develop strategies to cope with a rising number of people migrating at national and international levels due to climatic changes and environmental degradation. This paper will critically analyze the term Environmental Migration and sets it in relation to a case study conducted in northwest Benin in August/October of 2013 with Bialaba, analyzing their temporary migration pattern to Nigeria. The aim is to reveal current discussions on the term \"Environmental Migration\"/\"Environmental Migrant\" and to discuss its conceptual limits. The qualitative study in this working paper was conducted in the form of 36 interviews with farmers in the Dassari watershed North of Benin and surrounding villages as well as with stakeholders of the local government and NGOs active in the research area. Research results are presented in the following paper to clarify migration motives for the Bialaba of northwest Benin towards Nigeria aiming to stimulate discussions on the topic and to promote new research pathways.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': '',\n",
       "  'Climate Change, Environmental Migration and Conceptual Limits': 'Climate change and its influence on human mobility are broadly discussed in academic literature and within the international community. Due to their high vulnerability, the impact of climate change on developing countries has been a major point of interest. The Republic of Benin is highly dependent on the agricultural sector. Thus it is severely affected by changes in climate. It serves as a good example for a case study on the influence of climatic changes on migration. The term \"Climate Change\" in this paper refers to the definition given by the United Nations. In Article 1.2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) it is defined as a \"change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods\" [1].\\nClimate change is evident in extreme weather events, such as droughts and heat or shifting and shorter rain fall seasons. It thus causes problems for agricultural work. The impact of climate change on land degradation, fresh water availability and weather events, along with a lack of adaptation strategies to face these impacts can favour emigration [2] (p. 43). This climate induced migration is widely referred to as Environmental Migration or the people being displaced as \"Environmental Refugees\". Some conceptual limits in terms of these designations have to be made as they are often used without a precise definition [3] (p. 39) [4] [5] (p. 10). The concept of international migration includes all cross-border movements, as well as fleeing forced by environmental changes, if it exceeds state limits. A clear distinction must, however, be made towards refugees after the Geneva Convention defined as persons who \"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country\" [6] (p. 3).\\nEnvironmental change as a cause for forced movement is not covered by this paper. In individual cases of internal migration, which can be related to environmental changes, the right of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) may apply. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement by the United Nations, established in 1998, provide a framework for protecting victims of natural disasters who do not cross an international border [7] (p. 1). These guidelines offer a set of legal standards for protection, but it is not clear if people who migrate due to gradual process of environmental degradation are covered by the definition. Since the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement by the UN do not regard cross-border migration, the legal status of people crossing borders due to environmental changes remains uncovered. The Council of Europe suggested taking the IDP principles as a model to create a global guiding framework for the protection of displaced persons crossing international borders as a consequence of climate change and natural disasters [8]. So far no document has been prepared. Nonetheless, the Guiding Principles were used at the Kampala Convention for the protection of IDPs in Africa [9]. The African Union adopted it in 2009 and it went into force at the end of 2012 [10]. It is thus the first legally binding regional instrument in the world to enforce a responsibility of States to protect and assist IDPs, including persons displaced by natural or man-made disasters [11] (p. 17). This may prove an impetus for the convention to consider cross-border migration caused by compelling environmental reasons in the future.\\nA variety of concepts and definitions of the term \"Environmental Refugee\" [12] or \"Environmental Migrants\" [4] exist. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) suggests the following definition for environmental migrants: \"Persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad\" [13] (pp. 1,2).\\nA variety of environmental reasons are mentioned for the emergence of environmental migration by the IOM, including slow-onset disasters as well as continuing environmental degradation. The latter can be seen in the form of desertification, reduction of soil fertility, coastal and soil erosion, soil salinity, water shortage and sea-level rise. A large number of people are expected to migrate due to a gradual deterioration of environmental conditions [14]. Nonetheless, definitions of Environmental Migrants remain broad and have been looked upon sceptically. On one hand it is hard to identify environmental change as sole driving force of migratory movements; on the other hand the emphasis on environmental factors disregards other factors for migration-for instance the socioeconomic context and conflict situations. Numbers on estimations of future climate induced migrants are available, but differ widely [15] (p. 6.). Nonetheless, environmental changes are already causing substantial population movements. The occurrence of storms, droughts and floods has tripled over the last thirty years [16] (p. 5). The IOM revealed 20 million people were displaced due to extreme weather events in 2007 [16]. In comparison, in the same year 4.6 million people were internally displaced by conflict and violence [16] (p. 9). Forecasts made estimating future Environmental Migrants, internal and cross-border migrants, vary between 25 million and 1 billion by 2050 [14].\\nHistorically considered, environmental migration is not a newly occurring problem. However, the accumulation of environmental crisis, the complication of the cause-effect linkages and the fact that today more people are affected by environmental crisis due to the growth of world population give the problem new emphases. In the Republic of Benin, where the research was conducted, the yearly population growth is at 3 per cent [17]. This means within 25 years the population will double [17] (p. 20). In comparison, the annual population growth rate in Germany is at -0.2 per cent [18]. Thus, it becomes obvious that environmental disasters will have a severe impact on the present population in the studied area and an even more severe impact in the future.',\n",
       "  'Research Area and Socio-Cultural Characteristics of the Bialaba': 'The IOM released a Migration Profile of Benin in 2012 which showed an increased number of Beninese nationals migrating to other West African countries. Reasons stated in the report are \"demographic growth, poverty, unemployment, increased living costs, difficult climatic conditions and dwindling natural resources\" [19]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) published a migration profile in Benin. According to the IOM report, about 4.4 million people, almost half of the Beninese population, have migrated. A huge part went to neighbouring countries. Approximately 69% of those 4.4 million people migrated to Nigeria [20] (p. 48). Ba and Kouton (2006) in cooperation with the European Union stated that improvement of the economic situation can be seen as the main objective for migration of Beninese nationals. Almost all migrants could be linked to the informal sector. The report further explains that while in the past mostly men migrated to neighbouring countries, nowadays there is a tendency towards a feminization of migration [21] (p. 14). About one-third of the Beninese population lives below the poverty line of US$ 1.25 per day. According to the authors, the migratory movements contribute to poverty reduction in Benin through remittances of migrant workers. Remittances between 2000 and 2009 are estimated to be roughly $28.9 million (US-Dollar), which represents 2.4 per cent of Benin\\'s GDP [19].',\n",
       "  'Northwest Benin': 'The field research was conducted for three months, from mid-August until October 2013 in the Dassari watershed area in northwest Benin. The research time was especially chosen because it was within the rainy season of Benin. Temporary migrants return to their home villages in this period for crop cultivation that gives us also an opportunity to talk to them. Co-Author Papa Sow has spent several weeks there between 2010 and 2014, gathering information on rural migration. The geographical research sites are the villages of Pouri, Porga, Dassari, Materi and Natitingou in the northwest of Benin (shown in Figure 1 below). The research area is bordering Burkina Faso to the west, which is easily accessible by the Tanguieta-Porga Inter-State road.\\nThe area of Materi in northern Benin was particularly interesting for the intended research, due to the drastic climatic conditions in the watershed area. The vegetation is a sparse cover of wooded savannah and shrub. The research site has herbaceous vegetation and crops. There are broadleaved forests as well as a closed and evergreen forest to its geographical west. To the east, gallery forest and wetland can be found. In the southeast there is also a 15 to 40 per cent occurrence of scrubland [22].\\nDue to its latitudinal position, Dassari is marked by a unimodal rain fall pattern with two distinct seasons. On one hand it receives a dry season of variable length between the months of November and April. This season is marked by offshore winds as well as cool and dry winds coming from the Sahara called \"Harmattan\"-which usually arrives between November and February. It is further marked by a period of severe heat, between March and April, with a daily temperature between 34 and 40 degree Celsius. On the other hand there is the rainy season which essentially determines the local agricultural calendar. Precipitation usually covers the months of May to October. It actually settles in July and the highest rain fall is observed in the months of August and September. The normal precipitation is around 1000 mm per year. A poor distribution of rain fall is noted in terms of time periods and local distribution. The average temperature is about 27 °C with variations between 17 °C to 35 °C [23] (pp. 15,16). ). During the rainy season, the vegetation is lush and varied -it offers enough forages for animals. By contrast in the dry season some of these species lose their leaves and become dead wood-which favours late bushfires. A large number of small rivers, Pendjari River and its tributaries, irrigate the territory of the area, but most of these rivers are temporary. In the dry season the rivers, except Pendjari River, are arid. During the rainy season, many rivers overflow and thus promote the cultivation of rice. Pendjari River is the only river forming a loop South, East, North and West. It joins a tributary of the Volta to the west of the town Materi and then continues to the region of Tampaga to form Oti River in Togo, before accessing the Volta River in Ghana [23] (p. 17).\\nThe land is a fundamental element of agricultural production. All members of the community have equal access to it, with the exception of women. The land was sacred for the family and inalienable. These days, more and more land grabbing is operated and marks the beginning of individual land ownership [23] (p. 18). The environment and thus the inhabitants of Dassari and the neighbouring districts are facing various challenges today: encroachment of the desert and desertification; degradation of the plant cover and deforestation; silting of shoals and streams; loss of soil fertility in connection with small harvests because of inadequate agricultural cultivation practices and chemical pollution of soils and water with pesticides and fertilizer-to mention just few challenges. Polluted water severely affects people\\'s health. Furthermore, chemical pollution caused by pesticides and deforestation lead to a loss in soil fertility and reduces the harvests of agricultural crops. It also leads to a decrease of livestock population, fish stock and plant diversity and risks food shortages [23] (p. 17f.).',\n",
       "  'The Bialaba Ethnic Group': \"The Bialaba, also called Biali, are an ethnic group living in the Dassari region, Matéri and in Gouandé, to the geographical west of Dassari. They represent about 90% of the population in the area of Dassari and refer to themselves as natives [24] (p. 382). In archives and literature the opinion is prevalent that this ethnic group must have arrived from Burkina Faso a long time before the French colonization [25] (p. 533). Many of the Bialaba transited to Togo before finally settling in Benin, where part of the ethnic group can still be found [23] (p. 19). Nowadays, the Bialaba consist of about 100,000 people within the area of Atakora, according to INSAE (Institut National de la Statistique et de l'Analyse Economique) there are 689,646 people currently living in the district [26] (p. 60). The Bialaba are farmers and grow a variety of crops, mainly millet, sorghum and corn. Farming methods are basic, the hoe being the primary tool for cultivation.\\nThe borders of the Bialaba language area can be roughly marked to the west with Togo and Benin and to the North and East by the national interstate road. Bialaba can also be found in Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria and in Central Benin. They have mainly left the area in search of productive farm land and thus should not be looked upon as separated communities. According to the numbers revealed by INSAE, the Bialaba form about 7 per cent of the population in the Atakora district [27] (p. 1f.). They have been permanently settled in the area over the last centuries, but have been forced into migration in search of productive land towards Nigeria and the centre of Benin, as will be further analysed in the research results. Peasants of the Dassari area and the Atakora district in general are especially affected by soil degradation [28] (p. 54). The high occurrence of migration in this area can be linked to climate variability and difficulties in agricultural production [24] (p. 382f.).\\nWhile churches and mosques can be found in the Dassari region and some Bialaba practise Christianity and Islam, the majority of the Bialaba practise animism or nature worship. Fetishes and wise men with mystical powers play an important role in Bialaba society. The phenomenon of polygamy is widespread in nearly all villages and among all ethnic groups within Benin and has nothing to do with being catholic. Polygamous marriages are allowed in Benin, but do not enjoy the same legal protections and benefits of monogamous marriages, especially concerning the right of inheritance [29].\",\n",
       "  'Methodology': '',\n",
       "  'Research Design and Methodology': 'The conducted field research is based on qualitative methods. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and expert interviews with different stakeholders were chosen as main source for information and exchange. A total of 36 interviews were conducted throughout this research [30]. Thirty-two interviews were made individually with farmers in northwest Benin, returning from long-or short term migration to neighbouring countries and within West Africa. Also 14 of the respondents were women. During the interviews, the farmers were asked about their livelihood, their perception of climate and environmental change and personal migration experience. Furthermore four experts, representing different NGOs, and the local government were interviewed. All interviews intended to gain a deeper understanding of the study area and the motivations and consequences of migratory movements in the area.\\nAlthough some farmers that we interviewed spoke French, in most cases we had to rely on our guide Kiatti. The majority of the time we would pose the question in French and the guide would then translate it to the local language biali for the interviewed person. Afterwards, he translated the answer of the interviewees into French. The interviews thus needed more time and sometimes the guide was only able to summarize what the respondents had said before. Interviewees were chosen by snowball effect, all 36 interviews conducted were audio-recorded and later on transcribed in French. The quotes that can be found in this paper are translated quotes of the transcriptions made. Working with a field assistant and translator facilitated working in the field due to contacts and esteem, which the latter had in the community. People were willing to spend almost two hours of their time with us, analysing changes in society and environment and sharing their views with us. As we were especially concerned with interviewing an equal amount of men and women, we were often confronted with shy and cautious women, which could be linked to their position within Bialaba society. Women are representatives of the household and mainly act within the family, while men present the family outwardly. With young men it was a similar situation. Men that were already older in age and married, on the other hand, enjoyed sharing their views very much and seemed to be more used to exchanging their ideas. Being scientists from the \"outside\", we sometimes had the impression people interpreted us as being development worker and told us which equipment we could offer for the facilitation of their work. This did not influence the specific questions on migration and climate change.\\nIt must be acknowledged at this point that the data evaluated was collected in Benin. Thus, only return migrants could be interviewed, which makes it hard to evaluate if temporary migration is representative of the overall Bialaba outmigration. Migrants who stayed in Nigeria for good could not be considered in this research.',\n",
       "  'Grounded Theory': 'The methodology of grounded theory is the driving force in this research. No theory development was made prior to the collection of data [31]. Guidelines for ethical research that were taken into account during the research were based on Friebertshäuser: the insuring of data privacy for respondents so as to cause the examinee no harm; the disclosure and explanation of the research intention at the beginning of the interviews; and the authorization by interviewees to conduct research on them. The handling of findings in consideration of the interviewees is also ensured [32].\\nThis research was conducted with grounded theory (Glaser/Strauss 1967) and suggests a theory built on empirical findings [33] (p. 1f.). Glaser and Strauss were not aiming at the verification of known hypotheses, because they do not help to understand social transformation processes; nor do they provide an insight into hitherto unexplored areas of the social. What they aimed for was to generate new theoretical knowledge. This knowledge can be discovered through intensive examination of the empirical. Thus, the relation of theory and empiricism forms the centre of their considerations [34] (p. 2f.). There is a continuous dialogue between theoretical presumptions and the obtained data [35] (p. 93).\\nGrounded theory strives on the one hand for \"planned flexibility\", meaning hypothetical presumptions which are necessary and useful for a new research field. On the other hand it has to be flexible and open, because presumptions can change in the research process [34]. The method of grounded theory aims at giving a middle range theory related to a clear area that will be useful in practice. Interview transcripts and observation protocols were systematically evaluated in order to generate a theory. It is considered to be the best methodological background for this particular research because it aims at developing a realistic theoretical approach that makes the theory applicable in practice. It is a research approach that helps to develop a theory based on empirically collected data. Categories and codes play an important role; the data collected was transcribed and key points were marked with a variety of codes. Those codes were ordered into similar concepts, which then led to the development of categories that were used to develop the hypothesis. Memos were made in order to pin down hypothesis and to reflect on relations and patterns the data might contain.\\nThis method is well suited for framing and guiding studies of sub cultural fields, of \"small social worlds\", and the problems and perspectives of its members because of the interactive participation of the researchers. Data collection interaction between researcher and research partner does not take place in the territory of the researcher, but in the environment or in the milieu of the study partner [36] (p. 39). Furthermore, it is a good way to research a previously little studied area. Quantitative material is used to provide empirical support for the research.\\nAfter having given a differentiated introduction on Environmental Migration and embedding it in its current role for larger Africa, the specific research results will be revealed. It has to be acknowledged that all results from the research in northwest Benin presented in the following are only an excerpt of the raw qualitative data acquired during the field research. All names of the interviewees given in this report, except for experts interviewed, are devised to ensure anonymity of the respondents. The interpretation of the interview transcripts and the identification of similarities and structures based on grounded theory are presented with clarifying citation in the following.',\n",
       "  'Findings': '',\n",
       "  'Migration Movements of Bialaba': '\"The Bialaba are farmers, we grew up working on the field with our parents. We are farmers and also like hunting. Furthermore the Bialaba like to argue. Since the colonization we signed up for school and also started small businesses\" [37].\\nDue to the ethnic dominance in the area where the research was conducted, all interviewees belonged to the Bialaba ethnic group. The Bialaba are mainly agricultural workers and define themselves as farmers and livestock breeders. Hunting also plays a role in their self-image. In the field it became quickly apparent that most of the out-migration of the villages observed went towards Nigeria. Other destination countries mentioned in the interviews were Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali. Internal migration mainly focuses on the centre of Benin.\\nAll of the countries that were mentioned by the respondents are part of the Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS), founded in 1975. ECOWAS and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (also known as UEMOA from its name in French, Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine) promote the economic integration of the regional member states [38], but also guarantee free movement across borders of the participating states [21] (p. 11). This can be seen as a major reason for migration movements to neighbouring countries. According to the IOM, 98 per cent of the Beninese migrants reside in countries of ECOWAS. While the IOM saw the majority of Beninese nationals migrating from rural to urban areas within the region and beyond [19], the results of this research show a prevalence of rural to rural migration from farmers in Dassari and surrounding villages to productive soils in the destination countries. The migration movements of the interviewees can be seen in Figure 2. The size of the arrows shows the number of migrants with the same destination. Doevenspeck (2011) analyzed internal migration movements in Benin and also came to the conclusion that migration on the national level is coined by rural-rural migration [28] (p. 55). For the Republic of Benin in general, as well as the researched area, Nigeria remains the number one migration destination with 69% of the emigrated population [19]. In the conducted interviews, multiple migration destinations were mentioned by single respondents. Nonetheless, 27 of the interviewees (as indicated on Figure 2) migrated to Nigeria at some point of their lives, representing about 84 per cent of the respondents. The prevalent migration pattern of the interviewees of this research was from the agricultural to the agricultural sector, migrating from rural areas in of the Republic of Benin to rural areas in Nigeria.',\n",
       "  'More Emigration than Immigration': 'The majority of the interviewees perceived a larger amount of people emigrating abroad than people coming to the area to settle down. People who migrated can be linked to the informal sector and are mainly agricultural workers in search of employment in the agricultural sector. Although many Bialaba leave for Nigeria, they remain attached to ancestral practices and present a highly mobile group, often returning to Benin for family visits and obligations [24] (p. 382). Ba and Kouton (2006) also linked people leaving the country of Benin for neighbouring countries to the informal sector. For the global south they revealed that about 71 per cent of the people migrating belonged to the informal sector. In comparison, migrants of the informal sector migrating to countries in the global north only present 26 per cent [21] (p. 15). \"There are people who immigrate, but their number is not as big in comparison to us who emigrate. There are the Fulani who come from Nigeria, but they are not numerous. They come for their small businesses, but not to settle down\" [39].\\nRespondents stated that there are few people immigrating to the area, arriving from neighbouring countries [39][40][41]. They come for trade and small business, but not to permanently settle. The main group which settles in the Dassari area are return migrants. They worked and stayed in Nigeria for years and in time decided to come back to their home villages [42,43]. A group of people who started settling in the area of northwest Benin are migrants from neighbouring Burkina Faso. Inhabitants of Burkina Faso are facing problems with the productiveness of the soils at home and thus migrate to northwest Benin where soils are perceived as being more productive [44,45]. This migration pattern can be explained with the geographical location and accessibility of Dassari. It is located at the border with Burkina Faso in the far northwest of Benin.\\nOn a national level immigrants from Burkina Faso play a rather small role, but they are very efficient in sectors such as trade and fishing. The largest foreign communities in the country of Benin are from Niger with almost 35 per cent, Togo with 22 per cent and Nigeria with 20 per cent other West African countries including Burkina Faso only amount to 11.6 per cent [19]. For the small number of immigrants, reasons for Benin as a country of destination are manifold and cannot only be linked to less productive soils in the migrant\\'s home country [28] (p. 51). Immigrants in Benin mentioned the country\\'s stable political system, growing GDP and improved economic activities as well as permeable borders as migration motivations [19]. It has to be acknowledged, though, that those reasons given by the IOM are more adequate for the coastal regions of Benin where industrially and economically relevant activities are concentrated. For migration to rural areas those factors hardly come into play -as will be revealed in the following.',\n",
       "  'Internal Migration': \"Migratory movements within the national borders of Benin play an important role for the Bialaba people. Seven of the interviewees migrated within Benin. In five cases, migration concerned adult farmers going to the centre and south of Benin to the areas of Borgou and Zou North to work on relatively productive soils as temporary migrants [24] (p. 382) [42,[46][47][48][49]. The other two interviewees were male students. Their migration was directed to the same area, but for a shorter time period. The migration movements from northwest towards the centre of Benin can be explained with available soils in the centre, which was historically sparsely populated. In the past, central Benin served as a buffer area between the ethnic groups of Wasangari, Oyo and the Dahomey kings [28] (p. 55). Therefore, migration patterns of the Bialaba from northwest Benin to Central Benin take place from rural to rural areas and are connected with paid agricultural work. All of the respondents migrated for a number of years and returned to their home villages at a later point of life to reinstall themselves there [42,48]. Doevenspeck (2011) analyzed migration on a national level and concluded it mainly consists of migration from the rural northwest to the rural centre of Benin [28] (p. 61f.). The Migration Profile for Benin reveals that regional migration flows within Benin have increased. Based on data from the 2002 Population and Housing Census, the number of regional migrants has increased from 78,000 in 1992 to 157,000 in 2002, revealing it has more than doubled [19]. No recent official data are available to observe the new trends as a new Beninese general census has been undertaken since 2012 and data is now being entered at the time this paper is being written. A second interesting group of internal migrants are the migrating students of Bialaba ethnic group. They migrate to the centre of Benin during the school vacation period. Working in the agricultural sector, they help farmers with their farm work [50]. The money they earn during this short-term migration is used to pay their school fees and those of their siblings [41,51]. The motives mentioned for internal migration are the availability of soils for agricultural production and the possibility to find paid work in the agrarian sector in Benin's centre [42,47,49,51]. Thus, it is caused by a mix of environmental and economic reasons. Social practises also come into play, as exposed by the example of migrating Bialaba students. Older siblings are responsible for paying the school fees for the whole family and migrate to earn the necessary money [41].\",\n",
       "  'Cross-Border Migration to Southwest Nigeria': 'Emigration movements of the interviewees are mainly directed towards Nigeria. The town of Saki in the state of Oyo was mentioned as a primary migration destination [40,43,48,49,[52][53][54][55][56]. But also other towns like Abeokuta the capital of Ogun, Issangue and Adjuba were brought up multiple times during the interviews. Respondents\\' destination states Oyo and Ogun are in southwest Nigeria. The naming of Saki as primary destination for migration can be explained by a variety of factors. Firstly, it is directly bordering Benin. The short distance to their home country makes Saki a favourable migration destination for interviewees [40,42].\\nTransportation costs also come into play, explaining migration movements to a certain area. Respondents mentioned they explicitly chose Nigeria due to relatively low transportation costs: \"I also heard of Ghana, but because of the distance I could not pay for transportation costs for me and my two wives to go there. Nigeria is closer\" [42]. Moreover, the infrastructure and transportation system to Nigeria is well developed. It can be reached through a paved street, either by private bus or taxi within one day [57]. Thirdly, all vehicles from northwest Benin reaching Nigeria have their first stop in Saki. From there, migrants chose their final destination, either by staying in the state of Oyo or by continuing their travels [40].\\nTo analyse reasons for migration towards Nigeria more in detail, a differentiation was made between environmental, social, and economic factors, as revealed in Figure 3   Nigeria\\'s soil productiveness was the main motive mentioned for choosing Nigeria as country of destination. It was mentioned in almost 45% of the interviews. In contrast to the Republic of Benin, respondents perceived dense vegetation and trees in Nigeria. Beninese soils are described as dry and full of laterite [37,54,[57][58][59][60]. The productiveness of Nigerian soils supports successful cultivation and harvesting -being the second environmental related reason for migration [40,42,59]. Available soils in Nigeria also play an important role, as land in northwest Benin is very limited. The soils are described as argillaceous and more nutritious and it is noted that they can be ploughed by hand [39,[60][61][62]. The usage of fertilizer for corn cultivation is not common in Nigeria. Moreover, regular rain fall which facilitates cultivation, is often cited. All of those factors further guarantee food security, which is not a given in northwest Benin. As economic reasons for migration to Nigeria, about 30 per cent of the interviewees state the goal of construction. They migrate to Nigeria and return with means for building their own houses in origin at the end of their stay. Migration for the accumulation of money also is a very important factor for the Bialaba. The migrants then return to Benin with the money they accumulated during their stay. The money is used for manifold purposes-from livestock to buying crops. The acquisition of means for transportation is another reason related to migratory movements. In general these vehicles are bikes and motorcycles.\\nThe prospect of finding agricultural work is also a factor favouring migration to Nigeria-due to its productive soils. Landowners in Nigeria are looking for low-skilled agricultural workers to cultivate their fields. Migrants who go to Nigeria usually start a relationship with a landowner, called tenure system. The newly arrived migrants start working on the landowner\\'s field. In compensation the migrants share their harvest at the end of the season with the landlord [42,55,59]. Jean-Pierre Chauveau also realized this phenomenon for the area of southern Benin. He reveals a considerable number of young migrants from the Adja plateau arrive and seek for land for cultivation [63] (p. 11). What has been described as tenure system would be similar to Chauveau\\'s category of \"lema contracts\" [63] (p. 12), where a laborer works for the plantation owner in the morning, while cultivating his own field in the afternoon and sharing the outcome at harvest time.\\nMoreover, the lack and cost of agricultural tools in northwest Benin were revealed as reasons for migration to Nigeria. It is stated that in Nigeria tools are available, but are not needed as urgently as in Benin [39,43]. Commerce can also be seen as a reason for migration movements, but only plays a marginal role [46,55,64]. Apart from environmental and economic reasons, a variety of social factors influenced the decision of Bialaba to migrate. A quarter of the interviewees saw personal development outside of the Bialaba community and family bonds as cause for their migration. Information that spreads in the area of Dassari about possible emigration destinations is concentrated on Nigeria and further favours migration movements. The same is valid for social networks. People in the villages where the interviews were conducted often had family members or friends who had already migrated to or were currently in Nigeria. Thus, a relation with the destination country had already been established over the years and awareness of conditions elsewhere also enters the evaluation process for migration [65] (p. 51). Moreover, available resources in Nigeria were mentioned as pulling factors for migration movements [41]. The working and living conditions in Nigeria thus attract many immigrants [42,47,56,57,66].\\nRespondents revealed that 20 to 25 years ago police controls at the villages would prevent young people from migrating. In order to circumvent those restrictions, people planning to migrate would walk until Natitingou, which is about 75 km away. From Natitingou they continued by taxi. Presently, none of the interviewees were aware of any restrictions that would prohibit migration to neighbouring countries [39,50,67]. Recently, migrants who cross the border to Nigeria have had to pay a residence permit. In two interviews the price for this permit was mentioned as 2500 CFA, about 4 Euros [57,64].\\n\"Everyone without exception migrates to Nigeria, it is not only the Bialaba. All countries are represented there. Everyone is there because it is good and easy\" [53].\\nIt has to be acknowledged that it is not only Bialaba migration that takes place to Nigeria. Other ethnic groups and even other countrymen also go there, because of its good reputation in terms of access to land. The reasons for migration to Nigeria in this chapter seem to be representative for the migration of other Beninese ethnic groups as well. The IOM identified poverty, difficult climatic conditions, dwindling natural resources and demographic change (discussed in chapter 6.5.1) as main motives for Beninese emigration. Those points were mentioned in the research area as well. A motive which was mentioned by the IOM, but not by interviewees, was the increase of living costs [19].\\nMigration to neighbouring countries other than Nigeria plays a secondary role in the analysis of cross-border migration of Bialaba. Nonetheless, motives for migration movements to these other neighbouring countries are presented in the following paragraph. The country of Ghana was mentioned eight times as destination area for the interviewed Bialaba migrants. The majority of interviewees migrated to Ghana to do agricultural work and linked it to poor soil conditions and harvests in northwest Benin, but also for enjoyment [52]. Whereas migration to Nigeria was seen solely as labor migration, \"in the city of Encoco in Ghana I worked in the cocoa business, but I went there to develop and enjoy myself. I went to Nigeria to really work\" [49]. Migration to Ghana to a smaller extent also took place to work in areas outside the agricultural sector, for example as seller or tailor [46,56]. Niger and Mali were mentioned as destination for migration linked to trade activities [46]. Ivory Coast was associated with good land and prosperous economic activity; Bialaba emigrants who migrated here worked in the agricultural sector [45,52,56,68]. No explicit reason was mentioned for migration to Burkina Faso [69].\\nIn relation to the migrants\\' responses, the availability of productive land and the opportunity to save money and buy materials through emigration have to be considered as main drivers for migration among the Bialaba. Migration is caused by a fusion of different aspects where \"reasons of [...] progressive changes in the environment\" [13] can be seen as the major factor, but not as the sole driving force for Bialaba migration.\\nTwo of the respondents stated that there was also a change in the rain fall pattern and harvest outcome in Nigeria these days. They cited a drop in precipitation in Nigeria as leading to a cut of the harvests there. Although this was only mentioned by two interviewees and also displayed as not being as severe as in northwest Benin, it has to be considered as significant for future migration movements of the Bialaba [53,56].',\n",
       "  'Profile of Male Migrants': 'Through the evaluation of the data, several profiles of migrants emerged. It became obvious that migration movements from the Dassari watershed area towards Nigeria are mainly characterized by male migration. The interviewed women predominantly stated that the decision to migrate was made by their husbands. The majority of male migrants were unmarried and without children during their first migration, but multiple migrations are very common among the Bialaba. Doevenspeck\\'s study on Environment and Migration in North Benin underlines this migration pattern. He conducted interviews in a destination area for migration in the centre of Benin. The largest part of the interviewees he consulted did not directly arrive from their home villages to his study area, but migrated numerous times throughout their life course [28] (p. 61). In comparison to his study, we are aiming at analyzing cross border movements between Benin and Nigeria. Migration to Nigeria among the Bialaba respondents of this research took place primarily in the age group between 20 and 45 years. Temporary migration plays a significant role in the analysis of Bialaba migration. The journey to Nigeria is often limited to the dry season in Benin.\\n\"There are many people who emigrate. There are still more people who migrate in the dry season to work abroad and return afterwards. They go abroad to do agricultural work and return with motorcycles and building material. My children also went abroad, that\\'s why I have a zinc roof on my house. Many go to Nigeria at the moment. The Ivory Coast is a bit too far, but there are also people who go there. In recent years, many more people have gone to Nigeria in search of a better life, because the rain was not sufficient here\" [58].\\nIt was revealed in the interviews that Bialaba migrants who go to Nigeria are able to work a second harvest there. While Benin has a long dry season from November until April [23] (p. 15f.), Nigeria still has rain fall during that time. So instead of staying in Dassari not being able to cultivate, Dassari men chose to temporary migrate to Nigeria and return to their home villages in Benin when the rains arrive [43,64]. The rainy season starts in February or March in the coastal and south-eastern regions of Nigeria. In the far north it only commences by June or July. The states of Oyo and Ogun, which were mentioned as primary destination regions, are located towards the southwest and coastal regions of Nigeria. In the Climate Change Knowledge Portal of the Worldbank, the rain season for the two states of Oyo and Ogun has been documented to commence in April in average in the years between 1990 and 2009 [70].\\nIn August, a dip in rain fall is perceived, but it is rarely completely dry in Nigeria. This dip is even considered useful for agricultural work. Due to the brief drier period grain harvesting is possible. From December to February the Harmattan winds arrive in Nigeria. Thus, migration patterns from northwest Benin to southern Nigeria could be explained as deriving from fewer natural restrictions for cultivation. The dry season in Nigeria is significantly shorter and strong winds are not as present in the south of Nigeria as in northwest Benin [71].\\nIt is also remarkable that Bialaba migration never takes place individually. All migrants interviewed were accompanied by somebody to Nigeria and other migration destinations. They were mainly \"escorted\" by friends or siblings who had migrated to the destination areas before. It was stated that no Bialaba can leave by himself, which seems to be a culturally instituted practice [67]. Very common also is the desire to return to the village of origin to pass one\\'s final years of life at home. Most migration movements take place for a goal -the construction of roofs of sheet metal or earning and accumulation to pay bulls, tractors, mills, school fees or even for daily necessities. With the achievement of their goals or the coming of old age, the former migrants return to their villages to settle down. \"When I left, I did not leave to stay. I left for a purpose. And as I reached my goal and got older...My goal was to build a house, have a mill, a bicycle, a motorcycle...I got it all\" [67].\\nOther interviewees linked their decision to return simply to family and environmental bonds, \"every migrant who went out always wants to be at home after a while\" [47]. The opinion that it is favourable to die at home rather than to die abroad was also mentioned as a reason [49,72]. Another important reason for the Bialaba to return to their home villages is the death of a family chief. There upon the responsibility for the family falls in the hands of the oldest son. In the event he has migrated, the eldest son returns to his village of origin, settles in his father\\'s house and takes charge of family obligations. Eric and Romaric returned from Nigeria to their villages in Benin for that specific reason [61,69].',\n",
       "  'Profile of Female Migrants': 'In comparison to the male migration profile presented previously, a profile of female migrants also emerged. Although the research aimed at interviewing an equal amount of male and female migrants, finding female migrants in the Dassari area was much more difficult. Among the interviewed female migrants, three types of women who migrate were identified. The first type represents widows or women who have been left by their husband and decide to migrate. Secondly, indicating the majority of cases in this research, there is female migration based on women who migrate with their husbands. The third type which became obvious in the study are women, who migrate with the widows or divorced women to work in bars, sell drinks or work as a maid or servant. \"There are women who have already been there [in Nigeria]. Now they return and take girls, widows, or women who have been left by their husbands to work as domestics or in bars\" [56].\\nA problem associated with female migration was revealed in the interviews. Women who migrate without their husband are socially stereotyped and have a similar status to prostitutes within the Bialaba community with a position on the edge of the society [55]. Certain male migrants being asked about female migration go as far as stating some female Bialaba migrants prostitute themselves to get by in the destination country [49]. Grier also revealed this perception of unmarried women migrating to urban areas being regarded as prostitutes and social misfits [73].\\nOn a broader picture it has to be considered that female migration has become more significant over the past decades [50]. Not only for the ethnic group of the Bialaba, but also for other ethnic groups within Benin a rise in migration movements of females has occurred [21] (p. 4). Ba and Kouton (2006), who analyzed migration patterns on a national level, revealed that the majority of Beninese women who migrate can be located in the employment sectors of catering and domestic work. The authors see this prevalence as an extension of the women\\'s domestic activities in their country of origin [21] (p. 23). Moreover, they emphasized that the most significant reason for female migration is accompanying their husband. The authors found out that 60 per cent of female migration can be explained with family reunification and family migration [21] (p. 14).\\nSurveys conducted in the framework of REMUAO (Réseau Migrations et Urbanisation en Afrique de l\\'Ouest) in 1997 have shown that migration in countries such as Mali, Senegal and Niger is characterized equally by female and male migration. In neighbouring Burkina Faso migration from rural to urban areas is especially a female phenomenon [21] (p. 14). Adepoju also revealed in one of his studies on West Africa that the emigration of unaccompanied married females had blossomed and links this \"feminized migratory movement\" to a major survival strategy in response to severe and aggravating poverty in the sub-region [74] (p. 2). Esther W. Dungumaro, Gael le Jeune and the ACP Observatory on Migration also analyzed this phenomenon in further case studies for the countries the specific countries of Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Senegal, supporting Adepoju\\'s observation and giving further details on motivation motives and consequences [75][76][77].\\nIn some contexts in rural West Africa, as is the case for the Dassari research area, it is still not perceived as acceptable for women to engage in productive labor outside home. Migration away from their environment as wives and mothers is an option rarely contemplated [78]. A factor that did not become obvious in the interviews but was revealed by Ba and Kouton (2006) among others is that of illegal migration and human trafficking of women and children across Beninese borders today [21] (p. 7f.) [79,80].',\n",
       "  'Insights for Living with Climate Change in the Dassari Watershed Area': 'After analyzing migration movements towards Nigeria and giving a profile of the Bialaba migrants, the causes for this specific migration pattern will be set in relation to climate change perceived in the region. This approach shall allow a deeper insight into motivations for migration and help to distinguish between different drivers for migration. \"There is a significant change in climate. The soils are degrading, heat is attacking us now and rain is becoming a rare occurrence. Nowadays the rain does not fall in the same way it did during the time of our grandparents\" [49].\\nWhen interviewees were asked about their insights on climate change in the region, they often compared their present situation with the time of their grandparents and the way they lived. Nature worship plays an important role for the Bialaba. Tribal elders are responsible for the execution of rites to gain nature\\'s favour. Sometimes the role of those elders called \"wise men\" was mentioned as a possible cause for climate change. The Bialaba believe loss of respect towards the so-called \"sage\" and generally negligent cultural practices could be the cause of changing climatic conditions in the area they inhabit [41,45,49]. Fetishes to ask for rain and good harvest can still be seen across agricultural fields in area. Wise men place them during ceremonies for offerings by land owners. Overall, every person interviewed saw a rapid change in climate during the last thirty years. In particular, the changing beginning and duration of the rain fall season was often mentioned. Droughts and heat were perceived as occurring more often in the region and interestingly some of the interviewees mentioned that strong destructive winds came along with rain in recent years. It has to be considered though that no scientific evidence was available to contextualize the inhabitants\\' perception of changing wind strength.',\n",
       "  'Precipitation': 'Numerous interviewees stated that rain has become a rare occurrence in the Dassari watershed [53,55,59,64]. Moreover, it is remarked that once the rain arrives it does not last long [40,43,44,48,55,64]. According to the respondents, the rain fall used to begin in April more than ten years ago and lasted for a period of six months [45,68]. The rain period was known in the village and ancestors were aware of the best starting point for sowing [39,60]. Nowadays this is not the case anymore, the rain fall has become irregular and predictions for the arrival of rain and best cultivation periods are hard to make [50]. Currently rain fall starts between the end of June and middle of July. In case of the research performed in 2013, regular rain fall only began in early August. Two extremes are perceived in the region, sometimes the rain starts so late that the plants are not able to grow, or the rain cuts in the middle of the rainy season with the same result. On the other hand, at times the rain lasts longer than expected and thus destroys the plants [43,52]. In both events, harvests are damaged, and the reap is not enough to support the farmers and their families.\\nMaps produced by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia (UEA) and provided by the World Bank, compare the mean historical monthly temperature and rain fall in Dassari for the years 1960-1990 and 1990-2009 [81,82]. Unfortunately, the rain fall maps of the World Bank are only available until year 2009. While the first heavy rain fell in March in the years between 1960 and 1990, the first important rains were recorded in April in the time period between 1990 and 2009. This presents a rain fall shift of one month for the given periods. At the same time the rain period shortened. While it lasted eight months from March to October in the years 1960 until 1990, from 1990-2009 it had already reduced to a seven-month rain fall period (April-October).\\nMoreover a change in precipitation was noted. In the time of highest rain fall-in the month of August -there was on average 240 mm from 1960 to 1990. In the years between 1990 and 2009 there averaged only 210 mm in August. According to the Communal Development Plan of Materi, precipitation presently covers the months of May to October, but the Worldbank data reveals precipitation was already documented in April by CRU. The highest rain periods are in August and September according to the Communal Development Plan, but the Worldbank figures suggest that rain is most prevalent in July and August. The annual precipitation in the region was specified with 1000 mm per year, this is confirmed by the Worldbank data, where precipitation adds to about 910 to 1000 mm [23] (p. 15f.).\\nThe occurrence of rain accompanied with wind also plays a very important role in the watershed area. Respondents mentioned that strong winds were perceived to have arrived within the last ten years. While according to the majority of interviewees wind arrived separately from rain in the past, nowadays they come together [37,49,83]. Houses made of loam are especially vulnerable to the destructive force of rain and wind [50]. Figure 4 shows a traditional Bialaba house made of loam, which was destroyed through a heavy rain fall accompanied by wind during the research period in the village of Dassari. One interviewee goes so far as to say that in former times there was no such wind. \"Rain came alone; today rain and wind come together and destroy everything\" [83]. At other times, heavy clouds are perceived along with heavy winds, but it does not rain at all [62]. ',\n",
       "  'Droughts and Heat': 'Interviewees agreed that heat has become more severe in the region. Some respondents link their higher perception of heat with the lack of rain: \"there is no rain, and because there is no rain, there is a lot of heat, the two go together\" [43]. The heat the Bialaba cope with today is regarded as a true drought in the region-plants and crops hardly grow under the climatic conditions [48,50,62,84]. Other respondents see a change in temperature over time and reveal it becomes more intensive.\\n\"Life has changed and so has temperature. Nowadays it is hotter than before. There was heat before, but it was followed by rain and wind that allowed us to breathe. Today the wind is dry, it is unbearable. Rain is scarce and heat becomes more and more intense\" [39].\\nThe Worldbank data reveals that there really has been a change in temperature. While the highest temperatures between 1960 and 1990 were in March and April at around 31.5 degree Celsius, it was above 32.5 degree Celsius in the same months between 1990 and 2009. Farmers in Dassari also see influences of climate change on their harvests. Many farmers state they are obliged to work bigger surfaces than their grandparents. At the same time the harvest is less than that of their ancestors [55,64,83]. Interviewees explain that their expectation of a harvest at the beginning of the cultivation season is often not fulfilled. They complain that the harvest does not correspond with the work done on the field, which was the case before. Lack of rain is seen as a major reason for the harvest reduction [55,59,83].\\nApart from missing rain, farmers also see the lack of productive agricultural land in the region, demographic change and the excessive use of fertilizer as reasons for difficulties in the agricultural work and production processes. A minority of interviewees explain the expansion of the cultivation area with a different approach. They explain that their grandparents only worked for their food. Nowadays people in the area work greater surfaces to have a bigger harvest than that of their grandparents. Farmers today want to sell part of their harvest to afford other goods [83]. One interviewee stated that the world today had changed. Priorities now were amusement and the earning of money-becoming the absolute value for society [47].\\nAn expert from the Agricultural Regional Centre mentions that people migrate because they do not understand the climate in their living environment anymore. At the same time they hear it always rains in Nigeria and there is a humidity that allows cultivation at any point [66]. In the district of Atakora, doing agricultural work is simply impossible during the dry season [55,68,83].\\n\"People migrate, because they do not understand the changing climate. The change in climate is not favourable to agricultural work anymore. It is now said that it is favourable in Nigeria, therefore many farmers leave for the latter country\" [66].\\nRespondents mentioned that it changed in addition to climate variability over a comparable time period by comparing it to past generations, which is underlined by the data given by CRU.',\n",
       "  'The Water Resource': 'The role of the water resource for the farmers living in the Dassari area is very fundamental in their day-to-day life. Water is needed for drinking but also for agricultural work, to wash, to clean, to cook, and so on. In the rainy season, water is available at the local pump of the village. Due to the shortening rain season in the district of Atakora as revealed above, the extension of the dry season aggravates the water situation, because the area is not toted of enough water reservoirs. In the dry season there is barely enough water to fulfil the people\\'s needs in Dassari and the surrounding villages. Water is only available limitedly at the public local pump during the dry season: \"It\\'s a fight during the dry season. If you\\'re not strong enough, you will not find water\" [83]. The disputes arising among the population concerning the spare water resources available during the dry season sometimes even get physical: \"There are always fights about it, and people beat each other on it\" [83]. Many inhabitants have to buy water in the dry season from private fountains or search for water after several kilometers elsewhere [56,59,83]. The respondents explain that during the dry season they have to make sacrifices to fetch potable water and invest about seven hours per day to get it [39].\\nFormer migrants state that in their opinion, people would not decide to migrate if water was available at all times. If there were retained water resources or dams to preserve water from the rainy season for the dry season, inhabitants would be able to work in the dry season [46,47,50]. An observer reveals that there was a natural backwater in Dassari around thirty years ago which contained water during the dry season. Today, it has become dry [84]. It is mentioned that Burkina Faso in comparison preserves water for the dry season and people there are thus capable to cultivate vegetables in certain areas [58].\\nNews recently drawn from the Dassari watershed pointed out that an irrigation project is anticipated in the specific research area. It was made public in November 2013 by the General Directorate of Water Resources of the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Resources (MMEH), shortly after this research was conducted [85]. It shall be implemented in the Atakora district, but it is not yet clear which villages will have access to the project and when and how exactly it will be realized. It therefore remains an open question as to whether the implementation of such an irrigation system can reduce water and food insecurity issues for the inhabitants of the area during the dry season.',\n",
       "  'Discussion and Conclusions': 'The main findings of this study help to understand patterns of Bialaba out-migration. It showed that the Bialaba migrants are mainly male and below the age of forty-five. A tendency towards a feminization of migration has also become apparent for northwest Benin. Moreover, the migration pattern analyzed took place from rural northwest Benin to rural southwest Nigeria in search of employment in the agricultural sector and productive land-predominantly during the dry season of Benin. Environmentally related causes for migration were mentioned as driving factors in almost half of the cases looked at. These factors were revealed in the form of climatic changes present in irregular rain fall, increased temperature and the occurrence of strong destructive winds. Furthermore, diminishing soil productivity and difficulties in cultivation as well as a lack of soils were perceived by the inhabitants of the research area in northwest Benin. All of these factors lead to reduced harvests, thus causing food insecurity in the region. Therefore, it could be looked upon as Environmental Migration, as Figure 5 suggests. Nonetheless, the results of this study clearly show that beside environmental degradation, social structures and economic factors impact migration decisions. Moreover, the interdependency between environmental change or crisis and economic consequences on the one hand and social, cultural and political conditions on the other, makes it difficult to achieve a clear distinction of motives. And as Lonergan points out: \"It must be recognized that the degradation of the environment is socially and politically constructed; only through a structural understanding of the environment in the broader political and cultural context of a region or country can one begin to understand its \\'role\\' as a factor in population movement\" [86] (p. 12).\\nIn the case of the Bialaba in northwest Benin other significant driving factors which favoured migration can be found outside the environmental sector. In particular, economic reasons and a lack of materials and tools to undertake a profitable agriculture seem to encourage many young Bialaba to migrate. Moreover, missing employment opportunities favoured often the movement. Social factors also played a significant role in the decision progress. Limited space for personal development in the villages of origin as well as information exchange and social connections to communities in the destination area resulted in migration. Additionally, witchcraft and family disputes influence the decision of respondents to migrate.\\nIt was revealed that not only dissatisfaction at home causes migration. Favourable climatic conditions in Nigeria attract many Bialaba and support them in their wish to migrate. Such driving factors identified were available productive soils in the destination regions in West Nigeria. Moreover, favourable climatic conditions in the form of regular rain fall and longer rainy periods, facilitating agricultural work, attract many Bialaba. Through a tenure system of subleasing of productive land from Nigerian landowners, the Bialaba migrants are able to cultivate great surfaces. In return they offer a part of the harvest made on the surface to the landowner. Due to better harvest results in Nigeria it allows the migrants to store a part of the harvest. This gets either taken home to Benin at the end of the dry season or it is sold and the money is sent or brought to Benin through informal channels. Thus, the opportunity for crop and money accumulation is another driving factor towards Nigeria.\\nIt has to be acknowledged that even the definition of the IOM revealed in the introduction of this paper remains very vague and is only one of many definitions that exist. Therefore, a terminological ambiguity exists to begin with. Moreover, the voluntary circumstance to migrate which is granted by the IOM definition, stating Environmental Migrants are emigrants who \"are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so\" [13] (p. 1f.) makes it very difficult to clearly distinguish Environmental Migrants as one group and to link certain rights to their status. It is impossible to identify a migration stream as solely environmentally induced [87]. Interestingly the analytically weak concept is very prominent on the agendas of powerful organizations. It remains without a clear definition or strategic approaches for a common agenda to face the challenge and can thus be evaluated as being often politically instrumentalized.\\nFor the study, environment alone cannot explain cross-border migration from northwest Benin to Nigeria. Migration remains a selective process driven by factors on different levels. For the Bialaba it was a mixture of demography, economy, environment and society that led to their decision to migrate. Moreover, persistent immigration itself causes and enforces social and economic change in the region and consequently brings about new migration, which is explained by the Judex model [88] (p. 142). Judex demonstrated land-use dynamics in Central Benin and revealed that considerable immigration of farmers leads to deforestation and decreasing soil fertility.\\nTransmigration has to be considered instead of a unidirectional perspective on migration from northwest Benin to Nigeria. Although the inhabitants of the area revealed more people were emigrating than immigrating to the research area, temporary migration played an important role in the migration process. Many interviewees only migrated during the dry season and returned for agricultural work during the rainy season of Benin. Other interviewees stayed in Nigeria and other neighbouring countries for years to work in the agricultural sector to accumulate money and returned to their home villages. For the Bialaba social networks also had a substantial part in the migration pattern towards Nigeria. Almost all of the interviewees had social ties in the form of friends or family to Nigeria and eighty per cent even got support in form of money or agricultural goods through those channels. These ties also shape and encourage migration movements from one country to another. Furthermore, migrants from other countries settling in northwest Benin should be analyzed concerning their number and impact on the region. In particular, immigrants from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo, settling in the watershed area were continuously mentioned.\\nAlthough environmental destruction is hardly the only reason for migration, the developing consequences of climate change will affect a large number of people and lead to national and transnational migration. The UNHCR and the IOM identified two types of Environmental Migrants, which could be a first approach towards a common definition and understanding of the term. Firstly, there are environmentally motivated migrants, defined as persons who \"pre-empt the worst by leaving before environmental degradation results in devastation of their livelihoods and communities. These individuals may leave a deteriorating environment that could be rehabilitated with proper policy and effort\" [89] (p. 23). This movement can either be temporary or permanent. Environmental forced migrants on the other hand are defined as persons who are \"avoiding the worst. These individuals have to leave due to a loss of livelihood, and their displacement is mainly permanent. Examples include displacement or migration due to sea level rise or loss of topsoil\" [89]. This differentiated definition could be useful for policy action and with this distinct classification, it would only be a logical step to include environmentally forced migrants or \"Environmental Refugees\" into the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. On an international level, consequences of climate change for human migration are considered in the Cancun Adaptation Framework of 2010 in paragraph 14f [90] (p. 5).\\nLow income countries are especially affected by the upcoming challenges climate change poses. The case study on the Bialaba serves as a good example of the impact of climate change on the West African region and how it influences social structures, because in most of West Africa-including the research area-the majority of the workforce is involved in agriculture [91] (p. 18). At the same time, it is the most vulnerable sector to climate change. The region will especially have to find strategies to cope with the degradation of the local environment-including desertification and droughts-in order to sustain livelihood for its population and to preserve its biodiversity. Climate change may also lead to deeper socio-economic and political problems, since it favours migration, because people cannot continue living in the area of origin. The question is, for how long the migratory trends and routes of Beninese, from the North of Benin towards Nigeria, will last.',\n",

Using primary survey data on the demographic consequences of drought and famine in the drought-prone areas of northern Ethiopia, this study argues that growing environmental stress and persisting food insecurity have stimulated changes in the demographic behaviours and attitudes of farming communities, including: an increase in acceptance rates of family planning services; changing attitudes towards early marriage and having a large number of children; actual reduction in fertility; migration (particularly of the youth) out of the communities; and the tendency by many farmers to be involved in non-farm incomegenerating activities and employment sectors.',\n",
       "  'INTRODUCTION': \"T he literature on substantive demography shows that the concept of `demographic response' is the basis for Malthus's theory of population. The conceptual framework on which his essay was based is rooted in `response theory'. His principal hypothesis was that lack of equilibrium in the relationship between population and natural resources is followed by some kind of negative response from either side. Crises including famines are responses resulting, according to Malthus, from a lack of balance between resources and population. However, the most important illustration of `response theory' in demography is the very concept of demographic transition, which was initiated in recognition of the existence of response by populations to some forces of change (in this case, societal transformation to `modernisation'). Kingsley Davis' (1963) theory of demographic responses to `modernisation' revolves around this central hypothesis.\\nDo populations respond both to economic improvements and to stressful economic conditions? The evidence is that demographic responses exist in both circumstances. Populations respond favourably to economic development (`modernisation') as they did in the case of Europe, North America and Japan, and unfavourably to underdevelopment and economic crisis as they are doing in many developing countries today. When societies transform themselves to a higher economic level, both mortality and fertility decline, as shown in the demographic transition framework. But, when societies are adversely affected by natural or man-made calamities (famines, epidemics, wars, ¯ood, etc.) which result in a higher degree of stress, populations respond through higher levels of migration, increased incidence of mortality and ¯uctuations in fertility.\\nThe question at hand is: can changes in ecological stability as well as in the stability of food supply induce demographic changes? This study addresses the demographic consequences of ecological degradation and food supply instability in Ethiopia. Demographic changes in the context of this study include not only the short-term mortality and migration responses to crisis, but also the behavioural changes believed to contribute to changes in patterns of nuptiality, fertility and family planning. Analyses of local people's perceptions about the ecologies, which are presumed to be leading to changes in demographic behaviours, are at the centre of this paper's objectives. Special attention is given to the analysis of people's perceptions about the relationship between their numbers and the resource base at their disposal. Awareness and perception about the incompatibility between resources (e.g. land) and household needs indicate that the present fertility decline in the communities is indicative of the commencement of fertility transition.\",\n",
       "  'THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES': 'Research on demographic responses to socioeconomic changes has interested scholars of different ®elds, but demographers, economists, sociologists and anthropologists are in the forefront. The work of Kingsley Davis (1963) is particularly relevant for the present study. In his analysis of the demographic transition of the populations of Western Europe and Japan, Davis provided an analytical framework for the demographic responses to the social and economic changes that followed the industrialisation process in these societies. Davis asserted that the process of demographic change and response is not only continuous but also re¯exive and behavioural: re¯exive in the sense that a change in one component is eventually altered by the change it has induced in other components; behavioural in the sense that the process involves human decisions in the pursuit of goals with varying means and conditions. The main objective of his essay was to lay a theoretical framework that shows how socioeconomic stimulus produces demographic responses (abortion, contraception, celibacy, delayed marriages, migration, etc.). Unlike the present study, the connecting link between stimulus and response in the case of the European and Japanese populations for whom the framework was laid was not poverty but economic growth. In those societies, people started to realise that their accustomed demographic behaviour was handicapping them in their effort to take advantage of the opportunities being provided to them by the emerging growth of the economy.\\nAs indicated earlier, studies with focus on the demographic considerations of food shortages, famine, poverty, and so on, have been major research topics for some demographers. Bongaarts and Cain (1981) suggested a model that could be used to show the demographic consequences of famine mortality. Demographic aspects of the Indian famines have been areas of special interest. Dyson, for example, has done extensive work on the demography of the famines of the Indian subcontinent, in which he focused on estimation of famine mortality, interaction between famine conditions and epidemics, age and sex composition of famine deaths, and the longterm fertility responses to famine (Dyson, 1989(Dyson, , 1991a(Dyson, , b, 1992)). Reddy and his colleagues have also investigated the demographic consequences of the Indian famines, ®nding that occupational mobility is the most sound and direct response to stress (Reddy and Damodaram, 1978).\\nChanges in family structures and marriage patterns associated with drought and food crisis have also been studied using the Indian famines, in which periodic high risks of famine are found to be causes for fertility decline. The preference for having fewer but more educated children and having them married to urban or non-agricultural families has been found to be strongly related to stress induced by drought and food crisis (Caldwell et al., 1986).\\nThe link between social organisation and ecological stability on the one hand, and demographic stress on the other has also been studied. It has been found that where social organisation and institutional factors are weak, demographic stress causes ecological instability, and vice versa (McNicoll, 1989). Lipton (1983Lipton ( , 1989) ) discussed the responses on the part of rural populations to the increasing problem of land scarcity, in terms of agricultural technology, employment and demographic behaviour, and concluded that, although at a slow pace, demographic behaviours change in such a way that the changes contribute to demographic transition. These changes include postponement of marriages, reduction in fertility, and migration for change of occupation.\\nIn his investigative study of the demographic responses to drought and food crisis in the Sahel, Hill (1989) found some indications of fertility decline in the region. In his analysis of rural fertility levels and their proximate determinants, he concluded that the relatively modest declines in levels of fertility observed in some Sahelian societies could be attributed to changes in marriage patterns, including separation of married couples due to famine crisis. The main individual or household-level strategy for coping with drought in the Sahel is to move ± a response that has major consequences for the demographic development of the community.\\nThe present study argues that growing environmental stress and persisting food insecurity stimulates changes in the demographic characteristics of societies. More speci®cally, it argues that the stressful recurrence of droughts and famines have stimulated changes in the demographic attitudes and behaviours of farming communities in the northern regions of Ethiopia. The evidence used in the analysis is obtained from a survey conducted in 1994/95 to gather data on the demographic and socioeconomic conditions of farming households in the drought-and famine-prone communities of the country.',\n",
       "  'THE DROUGHT-AND FAMINE-PRONE AREAS: CONTEXTUAL DISCUSSION': \"Famines are prone to occur in the three northeastern regions of Ethiopia (Northern Shewa, Wello and Tigray), which are the focus of this study (see Fig. 1). Rahmato (1994) listed major occurrences of famines in Ethiopia in the last two centuries. His listing of these famines is based on records of chroniclers, mainly those of the renowned historian Richard Pankhurst. Although by no means complete, his chronological listing of the major famine episodes in the country since 1800 shows that there were nine major famines between 1800 to 1892, and 11 others between 1913 and 1994. All occurred mainly in the northern regions. In particular, the districts covered by the present study were affected by most of the famines.\\nStudies related to causes of famines have always been controversial. There are those who argue that famines are basically problems of ecological degradation. This line of argument adheres to the Malthusian paradigm and strictly believes that natural resource depletions play deterministic roles. Followers of this group argue that in Ethiopia, the carrying capacity of the environment has diminished and can no longer sustain people if left to Source: based on data from Webb et al. (1992), Gebre-Medhin and Vahlguist (1977); Mes®n Wolde-Mariam (1984); Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (1985).\\ncontinue under current production conditions and ecological balances (Woldemariam, 1986(Woldemariam, , 1991;;Admassie, 1995). On the opposite side are those who argue that famines are essentially due to unfair food distribution. According to this perspective, people die from famine only because governments lack policies that should enable people to have access to basic food. Famine mortality, in the view of this group, is preventable if it were not for entitlement failures (Sen, 1981;Webb et al., 1992).\\nControversy on the causes of the 1970s and 1980s famines was heated among researchers as well as policy-makers. As a result, progress has been made in the search for improved understanding of the causes of famine and of appropriate public action required to prevent it. It is now recognised that food crisis arises not only from ecological degradation but also from a complex interaction between supply, distribution and demand factors. It has become clear that, while focus on the supply side is necessary, it is insuf®cient for famine prevention. Thus, traditional emphasis on production failures that ascribe prominent roles to drought, ecological degradation, war, or policy mismanagement, have recently been complemented by a shift in focus to other areas. For example, the key roles of purchasing-power collapse (closely linked to employment conditions) and market failure have gained widespread recognition. Nonetheless, drought and ecological degradation are said by many studies to be the major causes of famine (Kumar, 1990;Were, 1989;Webb et al., 1992;Ezra, 1997).\\nIn none of the famines mentioned earlier have the demographic consequences been studied critically. Even for the most recent famines, there is no agreement on the exact number of deaths. For the 1984/85 famine, for example, estimates given in various reports range from 400,000 to about 1.5 million, with the majority of the reports estimating about 1 million. Most of the latter estimates were made on the basis of the collective judgement of donor missions, relief of®cials and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in various parts of Ethiopia, including the large relief camps. The most reliable ®gures came from the relief centres where records were kept, and from NGOs working closely with the Peasant Associations (PAs) and the local Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) agents. The only estimate that has applied demographic estimation methods was that of Asmerom Kidane, who put the death toll of the 1984/85 famine at about 700,000 (Kidane, 1989).\\nThe most remarkable and immediate response to famine crisis is migration. Like anywhere else, reliable data on migration is dif®cult to obtain in Ethiopia. It is thus dif®cult to carry out analysis on trends and patterns of migration. Internal migration in Ethiopia has historically been signi®cant, and the pattern has generally been from the northern regions towards the west and southwestern regions. This pattern has been greatly related to, among other reasons, the recurrence of droughts and famines as illustrated above. In the 1960s and 1970s, when some scattered and fragmented attempts at developing commercial farms were underway, people used to move to work on these farms for temporary seasonal employment. These are mostly the cotton and sugar plantations in the Rift Valley and the coffee plantations in the south. However, the magnitude and tempo of these movements were not known accurately. Apparently, the largest movement of people was the one which took place in 1985, in the form of resettlement schemes as a response to the 1984/85 famine.\\nThe resettlement of people from droughtprone and ecologically degraded areas in the northern regions to the fertile lands in the west and southwestern parts of the country is considered by agricultural specialists as a necessary aspect of Ethiopia's economic and social development. The 1984 Ethiopian Highlands Reclamation Study (EHRS), a large-scale socioeconomic and agro-ecological study of rural Ethiopia, recommended that resettlement as part of a comprehensive agricultural and afforestation programme is important for Ethiopia. The World Bank also recommended such action in 1986.\\nThe resettlement programme began in February 1976, although some small projects had been undertaken earlier. During the period 1976±79, about 48,000 families, mostly from the northern regions, were resettled in some 80 locations in the western and south-western regions. In 1984 the resettled population totalled about 200,000. The programme reached a new stage in November 1984 when the government decided to move nearly 600,000 people, mainly from the regions of Northern Shewa, Wello and Tigray. Unpublished reports of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission show that the government resettled 343,000 households or approximately 1,715,000 persons between 1980 and 1990 in the western and southwestern, less densely populated areas of the country (RRC, 1985).\\nIn spite of the relocation of a large number of families from the ecologically degraded areas of the north to the west and southwest, the problem of food insecurity among the remaining populations has not yet been eased. Moreover, the resettlement of people from the high density and/or degraded areas to the less populated or uninhabited areas has not occurred since 1991. Evidently policies change with changes of governments, and that is what happened in Ethiopia. The present government, which replaced the military government in 1991, restructured the regional administrative entities along ethnic lines, and that made it dif®cult to adopt a policy of balanced population redistribution through resettlement programmes. Naturally, local governments with autonomous powers to manage their resources would not admit other populations to resettle in their territories.\\nCurrently, land resources in northern Ethiopia are under increasing pressure due to two factors: population growth and land degradation. These two reasons have forced farmers to penetrate vulnerable environments in order to increase the cultivated area and compensate for low yields. In these areas, more than 90% of the land is used for agricultural purposes on a permanent basis, giving nature little room for regeneration. In many districts in Northern Shewa, Wello and Tigray, fallowing as a system of farming has completely disappeared ± a clear indication that there is serious land shortage. This implies that the primary natural resource base for the social and economic lives of these regions is depleted, and needs serious attention and direct intervention to reverse the situation. Under such conditions, poverty is rampant and vicious in this part of Ethiopia. Poverty is prejudicing environmental sustain-ability, as the poor, without alternative ways to sustain themselves, extract the remaining physical resources from the mountains, valleys, rivers and forests.\\nBased on earlier studies and the author's own observation, the situation in these areas can be characterised as follows:\\n(1) The greatest rural economic collapse and the most devastating famines in the country during the last several decades occurred here.\\n(2) The north has been preoccupied with protracted warfare that worsened the economic decline.\\n(3) There are fewer roads, and the populations are more isolated, than in any other areas of agricultural Ethiopia. (4) The receipt of emergency food aid, which has saved countless lives but has hardly improved livelihoods, began in 1973 and is continuing to date. (5) There is a relatively short duration of the rainy season (June to September) compared with the more southerly parts of the country. ( 6) The area has the most rugged terrain of the country's highland massif, which is vulnerable to topsoil erosion. (7) There are production deficits which induce people to look to neighbouring regions of the west and south for cheaper marketed grain, or labour opportunities on farms (Holt and Lawrence, 1993;Ezra, 1997).\",\n",
       "  'DATA AND METHODS OF ANALYSIS': 'The main objective of the survey was to investigate the demographic responses of farming households to persisting ecological degradation and food insecurity. It was conducted in selected drought-prone localities in Tigray, Wello and North Shewa provinces (see Fig. 2). It covered a major portion of the ecologically degraded areas in the country; 40 village communities (commonly called Peasant Associations (PA)) were included in the survey. The PA is the smallest administrative entity in rural areas, comprising about 500 households on average. The village communities selected are known for their prone-ness to drought and famine. The distribution of the village communities by province is: 12 from North Shewa; 14 from Wello; and 14 from Tigray.\\nA combination of strati®ed sampling and simple random sampling was applied in selecting sample elements. While strati®ed sampling is used to select the village communities (PAs), a simple random sampling method is used to select the farm households and the ever-married women from an updated roster of households in each selected PA. Using simple random sampling, 50 households and 50 ever-married women were selected from each of the 40 village communities (PAs). Altogether, 2000 households and 2000 ever-married women were interviewed for the household and ever-married women questionnaires, respectively.\\nThree sets of data were gathered in this survey. The ®rst set of data is obtained from the household questionnaire, for which the respondent is the head of household. The second is obtained from the 2000 selected ever-married women. The third is obtained from community leaders through group meet-ings and/or discussions. The argument about demographic responses to environmental stress has been made on the basis of information obtained at all three levels. The interviews with household heads and community leaders are used to indicate changes in demographic attitudes, while data from the evermarried women are used to measure changes in actual demographic behaviours. Indicators of changes in demographic behaviours include, among others, decline in fertility; increased rates of acceptance of family planning services; migration (particularly of the youth) out of the communities; and the tendency by many farmers to be involved in non-farm income activities and employment sectors. Indicators of change in demographic attitudes include opinions about: (i) actual and desired number of children, (ii) age at ®rst marriage, and (iii) the relationship between population and land resources in the community.\\nThe study is intended to cover a major portion of the ecologically degraded part of the country. As mentioned earlier, Tigray, Wello and North Shewa are the three most affected provinces in the country. Selecting survey sites in each of the three provinces ensures completeness of a study that deals with environmental degradation in the country. However, the scope and extent of degradation and the natural resource endowment in each province is so different that variations in perception and awareness, as well as in survival strategies and/or response mechanisms between provinces, are widely observed.\\nAlthough the characteristics describing the situational analysis of the northeastern regions are applicable to all three provinces, the severity of each characteristic differs from province to province. For example, land shortage is a more serious problem in Wello and Tigray than in North Shewa. Average landholding size per household is 0.51 ha in Wello, 0.87 ha in Tigray and 1.64 ha in North Shewa. And soil fertility is more of a major problem in Tigray than in Wello or North Shewa. During non-drought years, the average annual rainfall in Tigray is not more than 600 mm, while for Wello and North Shewa the averages are about 1000 mm and 1200 mm respectively. The extent of deforestation is also more severe in Tigray and Wello than in North Shewa. The majority of rural localities in Tigray and Wello are classi®ed by the Ministry of Agriculture as food de®cit and vulnerable to food crisis. In North Shewa, the number of localities considered vulnerable to food crisis is fewer. The severity of food de®cit in Wello is the most acute. For example, emergency food was needed in Wello for the entire ten years during the period 1984 to 1994. During the same period, emergency food was needed in Tigray for eight years and in North Shewa for six years (Ezra, 1997).\\nSocial, cultural and economic factors may also be important in explaining differentials between provinces in some demographic attitudes and behaviours, including opinion about age at marriage, desired number of children, acceptance of family planning, and so on. Ethnically, Tigray is inhabited by people who identify themselves as Tigrayans. They speak the Tigrigna language which is spoken in Tigray province and in neighbouring Eritrea only. The language spoken in Wello is Amharic and the ethnic identity in the region is Amara. In North Shewa, both Amharic and Oromigna are spoken. The Oromigna speakers belong to the Oromo ethnic group. The majority of Tigrayans are Orthodox Christians, while people in Wello and North Shewa are about equally divided between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. In economic terms, the Tigrayans have suffered from shrinking agricultural production for quite a long time. This has made them outward looking in terms of supplementing their incomes from nonagricultural sources such as off-farm employment and trade. Very few farmers are involved in petty trade activities to supplement their farm incomes in North Shewa and Wello. These differentials are clearly demonstrated in the present analysis.',\n",
       "  'RESULTS AND DISCUSSION': '',\n",
       "  'Availability of Non-Agricultural Sources of Income': \"Generally, agricultural production has been in persistent decline. Reversing the trend does not seem to be easy, although the government believes that it will achieve food self-suf®ciency, at the macro-level, in the near future.\\nFor the drought-prone areas, however, the problem is very complex, ranging from shortage of rains over which man has no control to scarcity and depletion of resources, as discussed in the contextual section earlier. Therefore, conditions of food insecurity are likely to form part of the lives of the populations in these areas for some time to come.\\nClearly, access to supplementary sources of income is becoming an absolute necessity. The fundamental economic resources (farming and livestock) are not able to support the peasant on a sustainable basis. Customarily, sources of supplementary incomes include the seasonal employment in some commercial farms (e.g. cotton plantations in Awash Valley, coffee farms in the southern regions, commercial farms in the Humera area, and other non-farm work in major urban centres). Migratory labour to these areas, which usually lasts for as long as six months, has been the main source of supplementary incomes to farming families in the investigated communities. Nowadays, these opportunities are severely hampered due to several reasons. For example, labour migration from north to south is no longer possible due to the ethnic-based regionalisation policy. Similarly, migratory labour from northern Ethiopia to major towns in Eritrea has been affected by the border war that raged between the two countries in 1998.\\nCreating autonomous regional states has, however, accelerated the growth of regional towns in the last ten years. Regional and zonal capital cities have grown tremendously, providing surrounding populations with some employment opportunities in the construction industry and other sectors. Although very limited in scope, labour employment opportunities also exist within the peasant communities where the wealthy farmers employ others to work on their ®elds.\\nThe other source of supplementary income has been the sale of ®rewood and charcoal. This was a major source of additional income for many peasants in North Shewa and Wello in the 1970s and 1980s. Presently, however, these sources are not easily accessible because many woods have perished, and the few left are under the close protection of conservation agencies.\\nWhat makes the stress acute, therefore, is not only the decline in crop and livestock production but also the dwindling access to supplementary sources of income. The 2000 household heads covered in this survey were asked to declare if any of their household members had been working in any incomegenerating off-farm activity during the 12 months prior to the survey. This question has two main purposes: (i) it indicates the extent of vulnerability; and (ii) it indicates the desire for occupational diversi®cation. Under ecological stress and land-resource degradation, the immediate response one expects from farming households is occupational diversi®cation and involvement in off-farm employment activities.\\nRegional level results (Table 1) show signi-®cant variation between provinces. Altogether, 35% of the sample households admitted that someone in their family was involved in offfarm employment. This is not very high given the conditions of stress and the need to supplement farm outputs by other incomes. Clearly, the lack of employment opportunities is hindering people's diversi®cation of occupation. In Tigray, however, about 60% of the households replied that some members of their families had been involved in off-farm work to supplement household income. It is well known that people in this region go on labour migration immediately after harvesting their marginal farms.\\nHousehold heads reporting that their family members worked in off-farm employment explain that their farm output cannot sustain them for more than six months, and that they could not have survived without supplementing these outputs. Peasants in the northeastern parts of Tigray are known for having very poor and small land plots from which output, even at good harvests, cannot feed the family for more than six months. Many of those who have worked in off-farm jobs acknowledge that their earnings are far better than the output from their small and degraded farm plots. For these peasants, farming has become a marginal occupation. Indeed, agriculture in those areas has become marginal agriculture in the real sense of the term. These conditions have a marked impact on the demographic behaviours and attitudes of local people.\\nThose who were not involved in off-farm jobs were asked to indicate why not (Table 2). The traditional explanation for peasants' failure to diversify their occupation is that they do not have surplus labour. They use their labour for their own farms. Respondents in this survey were asked, with special emphasis,  The response to the question was resoundingly `no, labour is no problem'. The following explanation was used repeatedly: `¼ because our farm plots are extremely small, labour is not fully utilised. Our problem is lack of employment opportunity rather than shortage of labour that can be spared for off-farm work.' Many respondents af®rmed that if off-farm employment opportunities were available, they would stop farming their marginal lands. Thus, assessment of the major economic sources (i.e. farm output, livestock products, and other supplementary sources) shows that the communities are in a precarious situation. The conclusion is that communities in these areas are found under considerable stress of food insecurity. As indicated in the contextual discussion earlier, this predicament has characterised the communities for over three decades, and it appears that it will continue to be the case for some time to come. Communities will need to respond essentially by developing an insurance system against the effects of drought. The changes in demographic attitudes and behaviours examined in this study are presumed to be aspects of the much-needed coping mechanisms.\",\n",
       "  'Perceptions of Ecological Degradation': \"Studies dealing with measurement of public awareness and perception levels about ecological degradation are very rare in Ethiopia. If there are any, they are reports of some NGOs or government agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The most elaborate and methodologically sound study on the subject has been the Ethiopian Highlands Reclamation Study (EHRS). As part of the EHRS study, a sociological survey was carried out in the highland areas of Ethiopia by a group of sociologists including the present author (Admassie, Abebe and Ezra, 1983) to investigate peasants' awareness levels about the problem of ecological degradation and their attitudes on the conservation measures that were widely operating at the time.\\nAwareness about ecological degradation can be seen at two levels±public and governmen-tal. To speak of government's awareness is easier because this requires a simple inspection of policy documents. Prior to the 1970s, there was no trace of awareness by the government, let alone by the public. In fact, concern about ecological degradation started only after the tragic famines of the early 1970s and the mid-1980s. Such concerns resulted in the generation of considerable amounts of international money to alleviate both food crises and environmental problems. In particular, the disastrous drought of the mid-1980s gave rise to a particular concern for conservation, not least in the drought-prone and less productive areas. Massive amounts of WFP (World Food Program) grain, used for food-for-work (FFW) projects, created opportunities to undertake substantial conservation work. The government now considers environmental degradation as one of the country's biggest challenges and has adopted several policies to combat it. An environmental agency instituted at the level of a Ministry coordinates policies related to environmental protection and rehabilitation.\\nMeasuring public awareness about environmental degradation is not an easy undertaking. But the severity of the problem, which has made the life of farming families extremely dif®cult, makes it safe to generalise that there is a high level of public awareness about degradation. There are strong indications that peasants are not only aware of the deterioration of their environment, but are also aware of the causes of this deterioration. The increase in awareness levels is a result of the sustained endurance to droughts and famines by these communities. Since the 1970s alone, the country has been hit by four major droughts : 1972/73, 1984/85, 1993/94, and 1999/2000. One way of looking at peasants' awareness of ecological degradation is to ask them about their feeling of what the future holds for them in terms of land availability and food security.\\nAsking the peasant about the future is not necessarily an intelligible question because he/she can mix many things together: spiritual beliefs, superstitions, hopes and desperation. However, the response to this question can be used to indicate the level of awareness about degradation. Some respondents scornfully refused to discuss the future, saying that this is an act of intrusion into the powers of God.\\nOthers were equivocal and had no clear vision of what the future holds for them. But there was a third group with the capacity to perceive the future in terms of resources degradation. This group was capable of explaining its outlook of the future by considering the relationship between population and land availability.\",\n",
       "  'Opinions on the Relationship between Land Resources and Population': \"In principle, land allocation in rural Ethiopia is based on a very important demographic factor±the household size. The present land tenure system is advantageous to larger households. At any time of land redistribution, larger households are provided with relatively larger farm plots. Land in Ethiopia is stateowned and has to be redistributed occasionally to enable newly-formed households to have access to farmland.\\nOpinions on selected issues related to the variable `household size' are presented in Table 3. Cell values represent those who replied `yes' to the questions. The tenure system has some degree of regional difference. In North Shewa, the frequency of land redistribution is less than in the other regions. Many households still own land that was assigned to them in 1975 when the tenure system was ®rst introduced by the military government. Land availability is much better in North Shewa than in the other regions. The general conclusion to be drawn from Table 3 is that people do not consider large family sizes rewarding any more. Results of this study do not concur with earlier assertions by some researchers who have alleged that the tenure system in Ethiopia encourages higher fertility (Admassie, 1992). Such assertions seem to be made without due regard to changing demographic behaviour.\\nA simple, general question was asked on how respondents feel about the size of the population in their community in relation to available land resources (Table 4). In North Shewa, only 39% feel that population in their locality is `too large', compared with 89% in Wello and 95% in Tigray. In North Shewa, the  proportion of those who feel that the population is `too large' is the same as those who feel that it is `too small', implying that population pressure is not perceived to be a major problem. About 27% feel that population size is normal. `Normal' in this context is taken to show no feeling about population pressure or no understanding about the possible incompatibility of population and resources. In the two other regions (Wello and Tigray), people seem to have a very different view about population size. This is a very important basis for the analysis of regional differences in changes of demographic attitudes and behaviours. The reason for the wide provincial differences in opinions about population is related to differences in landholding sizes. In North Shewa, average landholding sizes are much bigger than in Wello or Tigray. The average landholding size per household in North Shewa is more than 1.6 ha, compared with 0.5 ha in Wello and 0.8 ha in Tigray.\",\n",
       "  'Attitudinal Changes on Timing of Marriages': \"Perceptions and opinions of household heads on issues related to the in¯uence of crisis situations on some demographic events, including marriages, were examined. It is clear that postponement of marriages is an obvious and expected outcome during periods of drought and famine. However, delaying marriage due to a crisis situation is one thing, but changing attitudes on the normal age to marry is a different thing. Given the traditional customs of marriage arrangements and the values attached to age at ®rst marriage, this study considers change in age at ®rst marriage as an important indicator of changes in demographic attitudes and behaviours. Traditionally, marriages in rural areas of Ethiopia are arranged by parents and conducted during speci®ed months of the year. The work slackness of the season and the relative availability of resources during the season are the main reasons for rural marriages to be concentrated in certain months of the year. For the peasant, the slack season is immediately after harvest, which for the northern regions of the country is essentially between December and February. January is the central point of the peasant's slack time, when marriages and religious or ritual socialisations are carried out. More than 90% of rural marriages are conducted in the months of January and February.\\nThere is a very strong association between the level of the harvest and the number of marriages in a given community. Marriages are very few or even nil during bad harvest seasons, while they are more common than normal when the harvest is abundant. For example, no marriages at all took place in the survey communities during the food crisis year 1984/85.\\nRespondents were asked if it is common to postpone marriage during periods of food shortage. Without much variation between the regions, about 85% replied that marriages are postponed if harvests are not good, even when marriages are overdue. This is culturally disheartening for those who had to arrange the marriages of their adult daughters. The age at marriage for females is very sensitive. The commonly acceptable age at marriage for females is before any sign of puberty is observed. For that reason, the relatively wealthier households arrange marriages of their daughters even during crisis periods.\\nWhen the question of marriage postponement was asked of respondents, two important demographic questions were emphasised: (i) the ideal age of marriage for males and females; and (ii) the ideal number of children families should have. From the point of view of traditional norms, early marriage of girls is a sign of economic prosperity and social prestige. Female members of wealthy households are married earlier than their counterparts in poorer households. However, the ecological stress, which has been overriding the normal life of the communities under investigation, has gradually made postponement of marriages acceptable even among the so-called wealthier households.\\nTable 5 demonstrates that even male household heads, who are believed to be more conservative in these matters than mothers, seem to have some attitudinal changes, and some two-thirds of all respondents mentioned age 15 or more as their preferred or ideal age of marriage for females. This represents a real change of attitude from the traditional prac-tice, which requires girls to marry before puberty. It is presumed that these changes are attributable to the stressful conditions of resource degradation. The expressed ideal ages for marriage are, in effect, con®rmation of reality, because whether people like it or not, marriages in these communities are very often delayed due to shortage of resources.\\nThe majority of respondents, 1259 (63.1%), expressed that the ideal age at ®rst marriage for girls is between 15 and 17. Very few feel that girls must be up to 18 years and above before they get married. A group discussion with community leaders indicated that increasing the female's age at marriage to 18 or more is `good for the health of their daughters, but it takes time for the public to accept it'. They added that whether people like it or not, many families are forced to postpone marriages of their daughters due to the stressful conditions that have been prevalent in their communities for the last three decades. It is now becoming quite acceptable to see girls marrying at age 18 and over.\",\n",
       "  'Opinions on Ideal Number of Children': \"Asking about the number of children along with the discussion about land scarcity and land fragmentation is not only logical, but also a legitimate measure of people's opinion about relations between population and resource degradation. In this connection, household heads, 99% of whom are males were asked about the ideal number of children a rural family should have. The ideal number of children is an important predictor variable in studies of family planning. It is a good indicator of changes in attitudes. Family planning programmes have used this variable as an indicator of demand for or readiness to accept and apply preventive measures so that it can be possible to attain the desired number of children.\\nThe ideal number of children by region shows some differences, consistent with earlier results. The number of respondents in North Shewa who stated that their ideal number of children is less than ®ve are much fewer than  The conclusion to be drawn from Table 6 is that local people are aware about the incompatibility between population size and the rapidly deteriorating environmental resources in their localities. In particular, people in those PAs where land is scarce (Wello and Tigray) show higher awareness levels about the imbalance between population and resources.\",\n",
       "  'INDICATORS OF ACTUAL CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHIC BEHAVIOUR': '',\n",
       "  'Current Fertility': \"Fertility parameters estimated at regional and district levels for the three northern regions, using the 1994 Census data, indicate that fertility has declined signi®cantly in the 1990s. Estimates from the present survey data also show a similar pattern of decline. Data from the sample of ever-married women are used to measure changes in demographic behaviour of the communities investigated. As shown earlier, 2000 ever-married women were interviewed in the survey. Of these, 13 were discarded for lack of completeness, so that the analysis is based on 1987 women, of whom 1618 were in their reproductive ages.\\nFertility levels are estimated from data on children ever born and births in the last 12 months. Births in the last 12 months have been used to measure current fertility, while birth history data on children ever born is used for estimating cumulative fertility and average parities. The pattern of fertility schedule, which is determined using the age-speci®c total and marital fertility rates, is examined. Table 7 presents current fertility levels in the study areas. The indices are computed from the reported data on births in the 12 months prior to the survey date. The values refer to age-speci®c marital fertility rates and total fertility rates for the total survey population as well as for each of the three regions.\\nAltogether, there were 281 live births among the 1616 women in the age group 15±49 during the 12 months before the survey date. This translates to a general marital fertility rate for the ever-married women of about 174 births per 1000. Table 7 shows both the age pattern of fertility and the regional differentials in fertility levels. Among the three regions, Wello shows the lowest level and North Shewa the highest. These results are very important because they demonstrate consistency with earlier conclusions about the relationship between intensity of ecological degradation and changes in demographic attitudes. Analysis of marital fertility indicates that women in the age group 15±19 contribute 17% of the current total fertility, and the age groups 20±24, 25±29 and 30±34, 55%. Fertility levels stay ¯at up to age 35 and then decline sharply. This pattern resembles the fertility schedule of societies where planned parenthood is a norm.\\nOverall fertility or total fertility has also been estimated. Accordingly, the total fertility rate for the whole study population is estimated to be 4.7, which is 1 less than the marital total fertility rate. The total fertility rate for Wello is 4.2 and for North Shewa and Tigray, 5.0. Total fertility in Tigray did not decline as expected. This is presumably due to the society's transition from a period of civil war to a period of peace. The civil war, which affected the region severely, ended in 1991. The peace dividend had important demographic aspects. A large number of Tigrayans who were in the rebel forces were able to go back to their normal life and establish families. Marriage and fertility rates in the region temporarily increased in the period 1992±1995. None the less, the overall direction is that there is signi®cant fertility decline underway.\",\n",
       "  'Cumulative Fertility': 'Among the common problems of birth history data are the misreporting of the correct date of birth of children and inaccurate reporting of the total number of children ever born to a women. This is known to have serious effects on all the basic fertility measures derived from such data. Being aware of this critical problem, enumerators in this survey were trained to probe respondents and cross-check responses on children ever born for inconsistencies. The question on children ever-born was asked in two different ways. First, the respondent was asked to indicate whether or not she has ever had a live birth. If the answer is af®rmative, she is further asked to tell the number of children living with her, the number of children dead, and the number of those who are living elsewhere. Finally, the number of children ever born to a women is reached by adding these categories and by checking for consistency with the information she gave in a different set of questions that deal with her birth history by birth order. Consistency checks on these questions reveal that data on children ever born are quite reliable. Using information from the birth history data and the number of children ever-born, lifetime or cumulative fertility has been estimated (Table 8). Completed fertility is estimated by referring to the average number of children ever-born reported by women in the age group 45±49. The average completed fertility for all three regions in 1994/95 was 6.2. In Table 7, the TFR computed on the basis of births in the last 12 months is 4.7.\\nIn theory, if fertility had remained constant and both children ever born and births in the year prior to the survey were correctly reported, then completed fertility (which is a cohort measure) and current fertility (which is a period measure) should be about equal. Any discrepancy between completed parity and current fertility should therefore be interpreted as either under-reporting of current fertility or as decline in fertility. It is argued that the discrepancy shown in this survey is essentially an indicator of fertility decline. The disadvantage of average parities is that they do not show the variation around the mean. For that reason, the percentage distribution of all women by age and number of births is shown in Table 8. It can be observed that 85% of the ever-married women in the age group 15±19 had not given birth. The average parity for this group is estimated as 0.3 children. The majority (55%) of women in ages 45±49 had six or less children, although over 20% had nine or more. However, women in the age group 30±34 show the most interesting aspect of the matrix. Only 26% of these women had six children or more, indicating a fair amount of resemblance with fertility schedules of contracepting populations. The proportion of women who are childless at 45±49 is about 7.0%.\\nAverage parity results by age and region, shown in Table 9, are consistent with earlier ®ndings on the severity of environmental degradation, particularly in Wello. Average completed fertility in Wello is 3.8 children ± about 1.0 less than in North Shewa. This regional differential is attributed to the difference in the severity of resource degradation and the consequential public awareness about the growing imbalance between population and resources. Subsequent evidence on family planning attitudes and practices will support this assertion.',\n",
       "  'Cohort Fertility': 'Cohort analysis using birth history data has also been used to show fertility change over time. Trends shown in the cohort analysis con-®rm earlier conclusions that fertility has been declining in the populations under investigation. Table 10 shows age-speci®c fertility rates (ASFR) for all the ever-married women by  The data in the table can be read in three different ways, each indicating a particular fertility situation. Reading the ®gures on the diagonal (from left to right) gives the fertility experience of each birth cohort. For instance, women in the age group 45±49 at the time of the survey reported that their period fertility was 0.048. The same birth cohort had an age-speci®c fertility rate of 0.143 when it was in age group 40±44. This, when compared with the fertility of women in the age group 40±44 at the time of survey (0.126), shows a signi®cant decline in fertility. Similarly, the same cohort had an age-speci®c fertility rate of 0.089 when it was in the age group 15±19 about 30 years ago, compared with a level of 0.054 in the current 15±19 age group. Reading the table down the columns gives the fertility levels of different cohorts of women at a particular point of time, while reading it along the rows gives the fertility experience of different cohorts of women when they were in a certain age group.',\n",
       "  'Pregnancy and Desired Number of Children': \"Questions about current pregnancy were also asked to women in the reproductive age span. As shown earlier, 1616 women were in the age group 15±49 at the time of the survey, while two women were below age 15. All 1618 women were asked to state their pregnancy status during the survey time. Only 137 (8.5%) women disclosed that they were pregnant, while 18 (1.1%), expressed that they would not know whether they were pregnant or not. Of those who were pregnant, 48% wanted their current pregnancy to happen, while 36% wanted it some time later. The rest (16%) expressed that they did not desire to have any more children and indicated that their pregnancy was not wanted.\\nThe women who reported that they were not pregnant at the time of the survey were asked to express their future intentions about pregnancy. Respondents were given six alternatives from which to select the response they thought was applicable to them. Of the 1481 women who reported that they were not pregnant at the time of the survey, 96% (1444) gave valid responses. Consistent with earlier discussion, women in Wello showed lesser preferences for additional children compared with women in North Shewa and Tigray (Table 11). Overall, however, 34% replied that they would not want to become pregnant or to have additional children. Given the traditional norms and the cultural background of these communities, this indicates a major change in demographic behaviour.\\nWhether the fertility reduction in the communities under investigation is fortuitous, or a short-term response to stress, or a sustainable and long-term response leading to fertility transition, is a question that merits additional evidence and analysis. Towards that end, opinions about desired number of children, and knowledge as well as practice of family planning, are treated below.\\nThe ®rst step to the analysis of `desired number of children' is to ®nd out whether or not the concept of `number of children' is an issue among the study populations. The argument made in this study is that ecological degradation has forced the question of family size to be an issue of discussion in the daily life of households. With this in mind, women in the survey were asked if they do ever discuss with their husbands the number of children they would like to have. Of the 1618 ever- married women in their reproductive age span, 1568 (97%) gave a valid reply to the question. Nearly half said that the issue is discussed with their husbands. These were further asked to compare their husbands' desires with their own. The proportion saying that their husbands want more children than themselves are about the same as those who said that their husbands want the same number of children as them. The interesting aspect of this analysis is, however, the regional differences. In Wello, more than 50% said that their husbands want the same number of children as themselves, suggesting that conditions for family planning are more favourable there than in, say, North Shewa. The assumption is that, when the desired number of children by husbands and wives concur, preconditions for family planning are favourable.\\nAll women respondents, regardless of age, were asked about the number of children they wish to have, but only 1544 women furnished valid answers that can be utilised for the analysis of fertility preferences. Many still consider that talking about number of children is an act of intrusion into God's wisdom. Table 12 indicates that a signi®cant proportion of women (42%) stated that the number of children they desire to have is less than ®ve, although the overall mean for the desired number of children is ®ve. Interestingly, this average is about the same as the total marital fertility rate, estimated earlier. Opinions on `desired number of children' also reveal regional differences, with women in Wello expressing a desire for least children. This is consistent with earlier ®ndings of strong demographic responses in Wello.\\nIn order to look at cohort differences, the data presented in  , 1993). The corresponding number for the present survey is 3.5.\",\n",
       "  'Family Planning: Knowledge and Practice': \"The 1990 National Family and Fertility Survey is the only source of information at the national level on issues of family planning. Using this survey, it was estimated that 62.7% of all women of ages 15±49 had knowledge about contraception (93.6% and 57.1% of urban and rural women respectively). In terms of practice, only 4.8% were reported as current users of contraception (2.6% in rural and 24.5% in urban areas).\\nIn this study, knowledge and practice of family planning services is employed as one of the indicators of demographic responses to ecological degradation and food insecurity. Data on knowledge, attitude, practice and intention of future use of contraceptive methods were collected in the ever-married women's survey for this purpose (Table 13). Overall, 78% of the ever-married women of ages 15±49 admitted that they have knowledge about contraception. The point of interest at this juncture is the regional differential. Con- sistent with earlier ®ndings, women in Wello show higher rates of knowledge and practice of family planning. Women who were not pregnant and who were in their reproductive age span were also asked if they intended to use contraceptive methods in the future. Results are presented in Table 14. Over 35% of those who were not pregnant at the time of the survey and who were at risk because they are in their reproductive ages indicated that they intended to use contraceptives in the future. This suggests that the demand for family planning services is increasing and also signals a precondition for the commencement of fertility transition. About 40% of those who indicated that they intended to use contraceptive methods in the future came from Wello.\\nAnother important indicator of regional differential is the consent and approval of husbands to contraceptive use. Women, including those who were divorced or widowed at the time of the survey, were asked to inform whether their husbands approved or disapproved of the use of contraceptive methods. In all, 26% of the interviewed women revealed that their husbands were in favour of contraceptive use. However, a very distinctive gap is observed between husbands in Wello and those in North Shewa or Tigray. More husbands in Wello (45%) showed positive attitudes towards contraceptive use compared with their counterparts in North Shewa (13%) and Tigray (18%).\",\n",
       "  'Mobility as a Response to Ecological Stress': \"Migration is often emphasised as the most direct and immediate demographic response to economic crisis. Traditionally, the term `refugees' has been used to refer to people who ¯ee their place of origin for fear of political, racial or religious persecutions, or who leave their homes due to war and civil strife. Jacobson (1988), however, used the term to refer to the new and growing class of movers due to environmental problems, introducing the concept of `environmental refugees'. Ethiopia is a classic case, with such environmental refugees originating mainly from the three northern regions covered in this study. The country's resettlement programme discussed earlier was mainly designed to deal with environmentally affected communities in these regions.\\nThis study has examined people's percep-  tion about causes of mobility, particularly through a question aimed at determining whether or not migration was an important response to ecological degradation and food crisis. The survey households have, indeed, con®rmed that movement of people out of their villages, in search of food, was one of the survival mechanisms adopted in the 1980s during the height of the crisis years.\\nIn the sample, 674 (34%) households indicated that some of their family members left home to live elsewhere during the study reference period. Altogether, 1062 individuals from the 2000 households were reported as having moved to other places. Table 15 presents the perceived causes of migration elicited by respondents. While most of the reasons are not directly associated with stress, movements due to factors related to stress from drought and ecological degradation account for a signi®cant 23% of reasons. Leaving the village due to lack of adequate land, leaving one's family to work as a livestock shepherd for wealthier households, and moving to urban areas to take up menial jobs such as maid-servants or joining the army are reasons related to environmental stress.\\nBoth `left to work as livestock shepherd for wealthier households' and `left to take up job in urban sector' represent relatively higher proportions in Tigray, and `left home due to marriage' a lower proportion, than in North Shewa and Wello. This is presumably the effect of the civil war in Tigray, which severely affected the normal life of the region's population until it ended in 1991. For example, there were relatively few marriages in rural Tigray because the involvement of youth in the armed con¯ict was very high. Similarly, children leaving their parental home to work as livestock shepherds for other households shows that poverty is severe in the region.\\nThe survey data also show that for 21% of the sample households, migration to the temporary feeding camps or other areas was used as a means of survival during the food crisis years. The households that admitted having moved to feeding camps or other areas during the 1984/85 famine were primarily from Wello and Tigray. This proportion is extremely high even in comparison with the environmental refugees which Jacobson estimated for some Sahelian countries for the mid-1980s.\",\n",
       "  'CONCLUSION': \"These regions of Ethiopia clearly exhibit disharmony between the natural resource base and the population to be sustained. Land is the fundamental resource base of the rural people. This resource is suffering from different forms of degradation (erosion, over-cultivation, fragmentation, etc.). Today, land scarcity is the most serious problem in the rural communities of northern Ethiopia. This survey found that average landholding size per capita for all regions combined is 0.17 ha, while for Wello, where land is reported to be particularly scarce, the per capita holding is estimated at 0.10 ha. Under current production technology, this is considered to be insuf®cient to provide sustainable livelihoods.\\nThis study explores the impact of ecological degradation and food insecurity on the demographic behaviour of communities. Speci®cally, it attempts to measure the demographic 7.9 7.0 8.9 7.9 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 changes that have taken place in the period 1984±1994 and interpret them in the context of demographic transition theory. It hypothesises that stress and anxiety caused by land fragmentation, landlessness, drought and food insecurity have forced people to change their demographic attitudes and behaviours.\\nThe main focus has been to assess the level of public awareness and perception about the problem of ecological degradation. The assessment shows that on the part of the government, concern about degradation problems seems to be higher than ever before. Among other things, the establishment of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection in 1993 indicates the government's realisation of the problem. Similarly the public awareness and perception about ecological degradation is higher than many people imagine. People have started to understand the relationship between demand and supply of resources. Many peasants see population size in their localities as a crucial problem. The perceived incompatibility between population and land resources is manifested by, among other things, changes in attitude about the ideal number of children in a family. People in those PAs where land is scarce (Wello and Tigray) have shown a desire for a reduced number of children.\\nPer capita production is decreasing, and large family sizes are no longer perceived to be advantageous in agricultural production. Labour is underutilised as it is now in excess of the available land and livestock resources. Two clear illustrations of local people's changing attitude on large household sizes as well as the desire and readiness for diversi®cation of occupation are the common expressions: `labour is in excess' and `employment in offfarm work is better than farming the degraded marginal lands'.\\nAssessment of demographic responses is not con®ned to short-term mortality or migration impacts. Attention in this study is given more to analysis of people's perceptions about the relationship between land resources at their disposal and their numbers, which is believed to be an important indicator of whether or not responses are sustainable. The study argues that awareness of the incompatibility of resources (e.g. land) with household needs indicates that the present fertility decline is not reversible. Attitudinal changes, such as those that relate to desired number of children and use of contraception, are used to the support the argument. The proportion of women who have ever used contraception is 12%, compared with the national rate for the early 1990s of less than 5%. Within the surveyed communities, the response in terms of accepting family planning services is higher in areas where there is more degradation.\\nThe important general conclusion from this analysis is that people at the grass roots level are aware of the different aspects of ecological degradation. This is because their survival is directly affected (food production declines, land shortages, fuel-wood shortages, etc.). However, responses to ecological degradation in terms of combating degradation, intensifying agriculture, and changing demographic behaviour need to be motivated and activated by external interventions. Under conditions of dire poverty, external assistance becomes indispensable. There is no doubt that in an area where household incomes are extremely low, lack of credit facilities and incentives can suppress initiatives to produce more and to undertake conservation and land improvement activities on small farms. Hence, Ethiopia needs sound policy intervention in the areas of population distribution, environmental rehabilitation and rural poverty alleviation.\"},\n",
       " 10: {'abstract': \"Significant attention has focused on the possibility that climate change will displace large populations in the developing world, but few multivariate studies have investigated climate-induced migration. We use event history methods and a unique longitudinal dataset from the rural Ethiopian highlands to investigate the effects of drought on population mobility over a 10-year period. The results indicate that men's labor migration increases with drought and that land-poor households are the most vulnerable. However, marriagerelated moves by women also decrease with drought. These findings suggest a hybrid narrative of environmentally-induced migration that recognizes multiple dimensions of adaptation to environmental change.\",\n",
       "  'INTRODUCTION': 'For agricultural and other natural resource-dependent households in the developing world, drought is an important negative shock that can undermine livelihoods and well-being despite the use of various coping strategies. In semi-arid countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, droughts are frequent and their effects are magnified by deep rural poverty, limited government capacity, and exposure to additional political, economic, and health shocks (Dercon, Hoddinott, & Woldehanna, 2005;Kazianga & Udry, 2006). Historical, qualitative, and anecdotal accounts indicate that migration and population mobility have been a common response to drought, as falling agricultural and animal production pushes households and individuals to seek new opportunities elsewhere (Hugo, 1996;Laczko & Aghazarm, 2009). A growing concern is that climate change will magnify this process through increased rainfall variability, displacing millions of climate-induced migrants (Myers, 2002;Warner, Ehrhart, de Sherbinin, Adamo, & Chai-Onn, 2009). These predictions have been widely cited but also criticized for relying on sparse documentation (Black, 2001;Kniveton, Schmidt-Verkerk, Smith, & Black, 2008), creating significant doubt as to the likely scope of the problem.\\nFortunately, a small number of quantitative studies have recently provided new insight into these issues. These studies have combined large-scale household surveys, environmental data sources, and multivariate methods to convincingly address the consequences of drought and other environmental factors for population mobility 1 (e.g., Halliday, 2006;Massey, Axinn, & Ghimire, 2010). These studies confirm the importance of drought for mobility, but also indicate that household responses to drought are considerably more complex than is commonly assumed. Rural households have access to many strategies other than mobility with which to respond to drought (Roncoli, Ingram, & Kirshen, 2001), and in some cases drought can actually reduce mobility (Gray & Bilsborrow, 2010;Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004).\\nWe contribute to this literature by investigating the consequences of drought for population mobility in the rural Ethiopian highlands. This region is of particular interest given its endemic poverty, high population pressure on land resources, and exposure to recurrent droughts (World Bank, 2005). To address this issue we draw on a unique longitudinal household survey, the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey (ERHS), which has repeatedly interviewed 1,500 rural households since 1994 (Dercon & Hoddinott, 2009). We use data from the 1999, 2004, and 2009 rounds of the ERHS to construct mobility histories for 3,100 individuals, and then use discrete-time event history models to examine the effects of drought on mobility while controlling for baseline characteristics and additional community-level shocks. This period encompasses two severe droughts, in 2002 and 2008. Expanding on previous studies, we build multiple measures of drought using survey and satellite data sources and also test for nonlinear effects, multiple temporal lags, and interactions with other characteristics. To examine the potential for multiple mobility strategies, we consider both the distance and motivation of moves and conduct the analysis separately for men and women.\\nTogether, the results provide robust evidence that drought increases long-distance and labor-related moves by men in Ethiopia but reduces marriage-related moves by women. Below, we interpret these results in the light of the Ethiopian cultural context and the ongoing debate about climate-induced migration. We conclude that this case complicates the traditional narrative of environmentally-induced migration by indicating that drought can both increase and decrease population mobility.',\n",
       "  'HOUSEHOLD RESPONSES TO DROUGHT': 'In the rural developing world, many households are reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods, including soil, water, plant and animal resources. Smallholder agriculturalists, such as those of highland Ethiopia, are particularly reliant on the timing and quantity of rainfall. Rainfall and other environmental factors tend to vary over time and space at a variety of scales in a manner not fully predictable by households, thereby potentially exposing them to environmental shocks such as drought which can undermine household well-being.\\nFortunately, traditional resource use systems such as the grain and enset-centered agricultural systems of highland Ethiopia have been adapted over their long histories to repeated environmental shocks, and households can typically access a variety of strategies to both prepare for shocks (risk management strategies) and to respond to shocks (risk coping strategies) (Dercon, 2002). Risk management strategies include asset accumulation, diversification of income sources, participation in risk-sharing networks, and adoption of low-risk activities. Risk coping strategies include sales of assets, intensifying livelihood activities or adopting new ones, use of formal and informal credit, reducing nonessential expenditures, and drawing on social networks and public programs for assistance. In highland Ethiopia, rural households prepare for drought by accumulating livestock, planting drought-resistant crops, and participating in traditional risk-sharing networks (Dercon, Hoddinott, Krishnan, & Woldehanna, 2008;Little, Stone, Moguesc, Castrod, & Negatue, 2006;Meze-Hausken, 2000). They can also respond to drought by selling livestock, drawing on assistance from networks, delaying marriage, and accessing publicly available food aid and food-for-work programs (Caeyers & Dercon, 2008;Ezra, 2001;Webb, 1993).\\nUnfortunately, several problems commonly limit the utility of these strategies. Assets such as livestock are \"lumpy\" and cannot be subdivided, thus households may be reluctant to sell. Risk management strategies such as risk-sharing networks may have barriers to entry that exclude the most vulnerable. Additionally, when a common shock such as a drought affects a large area, the utility of risk-sharing networks is reduced and the value of assets may decline. Public assistance programs are often poorly targeted and late to arrive (Caeyers & Dercon, 2008;Clay, Molla, & Habtewold, 1999). Due to these limitations and to deep-seated poverty, many rural households are not able to fully insure against shocks such as drought and thus suffer significant reductions in well-being (Dercon, 2002;Kazianga & Udry, 2006). Gender and age biases can also magnify the effects of the shock for particular individuals within a household (Quisumbing, 2003).\\nGiven the limitations of these strategies for dealing with environmental shocks, an additional strategy that can be adopted by households or individuals either in preparation or response to shocks is migration or local mobility. In the rural developing world, the migration of an individual is often primarily a household-level decision, aimed at generating remittances and reducing total consumption in the origin household (Stark & Bloom, 1985). Migration allows diversification of income sources against risk across space and often across sectors of the economy (Rosenzweig & Stark, 1989), and can help overcome capital market imperfections such as lack of credit and insurance (Taylor & Martin, 2001).\\nNonetheless, migration as a coping strategy potentially suffers from many of the limitations described above: lack of access to capital or migrant networks can restrict participation (Curran & Rivero-Fuentes, 2003;Vanwey, 2005). Employment opportunities in nearby destination areas may also decline fol-lowing a large-scale shock, limiting the utility of local moves as a response to drought. Drought can also increase the costs of migration by making farm labor more valuable in the origin area, thus reducing the attractiveness of labor migration. Drought could additionally hinder marriage-related moves by reducing the availability of suitable marriage partners, inflating marriage costs such as dowries, and reducing access to the resources needed to finance a wedding ( Anderson, 2003;Rao, 1993). For these reasons, drought could potentially reduce rather than increase both labor and marriage-related migration.',\n",
       "  'PREVIOUS STUDIES': 'Previous studies of environmentally-induced population mobility have largely focused on finding an appropriate terminology (Renaud, Bogardi, Dun, & Warner, 2007), methodology (Kniveton et al., 2008), and legal framework (Conisbee & Simms, 2003) to consider this issue, as well as providing preliminary evidence of the nature of environmental effects (e.g., Jager, Fruhmann, Grunberger, & Vag, 2009). Early discussions of \"environmental refugees\" were explicitly Neo-Malthusian and predicted large-scale displacements based on the assumption that rural households had few other options with which to respond to environmental change (e.g., Myers, 2002). Recent discussions have been more careful to acknowledge the substantial scope of human agency in responding to environmental change, the existence of significant barriers to migration, and the important role of economic and social factors in determining migration flows (Laczko & Aghazarm, 2009). Consequently, as this literature has rapidly grown over the past decade, predictions of large-scale human displacements have diminished and use of the term \"environmentally-induced migrants\" has become more common (Renaud et al., 2007).\\nDespite this high level of interest, as of yet few multivariate studies have attempted to evaluate environmental influences on population mobility. Scarcities of data on mobility and environmental conditions in the developing world, as well as institutional barriers between environmental studies and the social sciences, have contributed to this lacuna. Fortunately, a small number of recent studies have successfully used survey and environmental datasets and multivariate methods to investigate these effects. This approach allows controls for a variety of other factors which have been shown to influence migration and mobility, including age, gender, education, access to resources and migrant networks (Massey & Espinosa, 1997;White & Lindstrom, 2005).\\nAt least five previous studies using quantitative approaches have investigated the consequences of drought and rainfall for population mobility. In an early study using descriptive approaches, Findley (1994) showed that that total migration did not increase during a drought in Mali, but did shift toward short-cycle migration and moves by women and children. More recent studies have used multivariate methods. Munshi (2003) found that international migration from southwestern Mexico to the United States decreased with rainfall, which he attributed to increased origin-area opportunities in rainfed agriculture. Henry et al. (2004) revealed that drought in Burkina Faso increased rural-rural migration by men but reduced their international migration as well as the ruralurban migration of women. Badiani and Safir (2008) showed that, in six villages in rural India, temporary migration decreased with rainfall for agricultural households and increased with rainfall for wage laboring households. Finally, Gray and Bilsborrow (2010) found that droughts in Ecuador increased local moves and international migration but decreased internal migration, perhaps due to the relative poverty of most internal migrants. Together these studies are largely consistent with the idea that when rainfall increases agricultural opportunities in the origin area, migration decreases from agricultural households. Nonetheless the Burkina Faso and Ecuador cases provide interesting counterexamples where drought decreased migration, perhaps reflecting a decline in access to the capital needed for costly migrations.\\nMultivariate studies have also investigated the migratory response to large-scale natural disasters. Halliday (2006) showed that a large earthquake in El Salvador had negative effects on international migration, likely because international migrants returned to work in damaged areas. Gray, Frankenberg, Gillepsie, Sumantri, and Thomas (2009) found that the Indian Ocean tsunami in Indonesia led to high rates of displacement, but that potentially vulnerable households were not disproportionately affected. In the very different context of the United States, several studies have also examined migration after Hurricane Katrina, revealing that poor and African-American households were disproportionately vulnerable to flood damage and long-term displacement (e.g., Stringfield, 2009). These studies suggest that environmental shocks have complex effects on migration that are not fully consistent with the Neo-Malthusian narrative: adverse environmental conditions often increase migration by vulnerable populations, but not always.\\nEthiopia is of particular interest in the study of environmentally-induced migration because of its deep poverty and long history of environmental, economic, and political shocks. Our research builds on three previous studies which have examined migration in Ethiopia in the context of war, famine, and shifting rights to land. Berhanu and White (2000) used retrospective migration data for the period 1960-1989 to show that rural-urban migration by women increased during periods of armed conflict but was not affected by periods of famine. Ezra and Kiros (2001) used a similar approach to show that rural out-migration from 1984 to 1994 was higher from communities that were perceived to be more vulnerable to shocks. Finally, de Brauw and Mueller (2010) used the ERHS data described below to investigate the relationship between rural out-migration and the security of land tenure in an environment of changing land rights.\\nOur study contributes to these literatures by drawing on a unique panel dataset that includes 1,500 households from a large geographic area over a 10-year period. Building on the richness of this data, we contribute three important innovations to the study of environmentally-induced population mobility. First, we consider both the distance and motivation of moves, improving on previous studies which have often treated all moves uniformly and/or ignored local and marriage-related moves. These moves represent a large proportion of population mobility and are likely to respond to drought differently than longer-distance and labor-related moves which have commonly been the focus of research. Second, we examine these processes separately for men and women, which is important because marital arrangements (Fafchamps & Quisumbing, 2005a) and labor participation rates differ significantly between men and women in Ethiopia (Quisumbing & Yohannes, 2005). By doing so, we contribute to a growing number of quantitative studies which consider how gendered social structures influence the process of migration (Curran & Rivero-Fuentes, 2003;Davis & Winters, 2001).\\nOur third core innovation relates to the measurement of drought, which previous studies have measured primarily via annual rainfall totals from weather stations (e.g., Munshi, 2003). This approach ignores the timing of rainfall, which is equally important from an agronomic perspective, as well as the detailed environmental knowledge held by rural households (Meze-Hausken, 2004). Instead, we draw on household self-reports of drought, satellite measures of daily rainfall, and a model predicting self-reported drought to build three alternative measures of drought and to test the robustness of our findings. This study thus adds to a small number of previous studies of migration which have drawn on both survey and spatial measures of environmental conditions ( Gray, 2009;Gray & Bilsborrow, 2010).',\n",
       "  'THE ETHIOPIAN RURAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY (a) Data collection': 'We use data from the Ethiopia Rural Household Survey (ERHS) which has collected panel data from approximately 1,500 households from 15 rural communities over a 15-year period. The duration, sample size, and geographic scope of this data collection make ERHS unique among household surveys from East Africa, and among a handful of such surveys in the developing world as a whole. The data were collected by the International Food Policy Research Institute, Oxford University, and Addis Ababa University and are publicly available (Dercon & Hoddinott, 2009). The study communities (Fig. 1) were originally selected as a judgment sample intended to be approximately representative of the rural highlands, and comparisons with the census indicate that the communities are similar to the rural highlands as whole (Dercon & Hoddinott, 2009). Data collection in the full set of fifteen communities began in 1994 and additional rounds were conducted in 1995, 1999, 2004, and 2009. Within the study communities, households were sampled through a stratified random sample, and then linked across rounds based on residence of the male head or, in his absence, the majority of household members. Attrition of the panel has been low at 1-2% of households per year (Dercon & Hoddinott, 2009).\\nData collection in each round included the implementation of a structured questionnaire in each sample household. This questionnaire collected information on demographic composition, assets, expenditures, agricultural activities, and other individual and household characteristics, and it retains many common elements across rounds. Previous studies using this dataset have investigated the consequences of shocks for household well-being (e.g., Dercon et al., 2005), participation in traditional risk-sharing networks (e.g., Dercon et al., 2008), and the impacts of development policies (e.g., Caeyers & Dercon, 2008;Quisumbing, 2003), among other topics. Our analysis, described below, draws on the 1999, 2004, and 2009 rounds and specifically on histories collected in 2004 and 2009 of household exposure to shocks and the departure of household members.',\n",
       "  '(b) Study areas': \"From an agroecological perspective, the study communities are characterized by rugged topography, temperate to subtropical climates with seasonal rainfall, and a dependence on smallholder agriculture as the primary livelihood strategy. The communities range in elevation from 1200 to 2900 m and in mean annual rainfall from 470 to 1300 mm. Rainfall is highly seasonal, falling mostly during a summer kiremt season, the primary agricultural season, but in many areas also  , 2010). Government food aid and food-for-work programs have been put in place, but are not able to fully relieve the effects of drought (Caeyers & Dercon, 2008;Clay et al., 1999).\\nRural households are primarily dependent on smallholder agriculture, which is focused on the cultivation of grains in dryer areas (teff, barley, wheat, maize, and sorghum) and on perennials in wetter areas (enset, coffee, and khat) using animal traction or hoe plowing. Livestock are an important form of wealth, but the median household owned only the equivalent of two cattle in 2004. Following the nationalization of land in the 1970's, land legally belongs to the state but households have use rights that in many areas have been formalized through land registration and certification programs (Deininger, Ali, Holden, & Zevenbergen, 2008). The population pressure on land is significant and the median household cultivated only 1 ha in 2004.\\nFrom a cultural perspective, the study communities are diverse and retain many traditional practices, as described by the survey data and a series of ethnographies conducted in the 1990's (Bevan & Pankhurst, 1996). More than 10 ethnicities are represented in the sample as well as large numbers of Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims. Marriage practices differ significantly between ethnicities, but most commonly marriages are arranged by parents and both households provide gifts. The couple then moves to the husband's parents' household and later establishes an independent household drawing on land and livestock from the husband's family ( Ezra, 2003;Fafchamps & Quisumbing, 2005b). Polygamous marriages and/or divorce are accepted in some contexts. Men are the primary agricultural laborers but women also participate in many agricultural tasks in addition to providing the majority of labor for home production. Agricultural work is also regularly shared through traditional labor-sharing and oxen-sharing practices, but agricultural wage labor also occurs. The burden of risks such as illness is also shared through traditional burial societies, saving associ-ations, religious societies, and kin networks (Dercon et al., 2008).\\nFrom a development perspective, the study communities are characterized by severe poverty, lack of infrastructure, and low levels of migration. In both 2004 and 2009, 35-40% of households reported insufficient food consumption in the previous month. Most homes are constructed of wood or mud with thatched roofs and dirt floors with a single sleeping area, and most communities do not have access to electricity, piped water, or paved roads. Additionally, most household heads have no formal education and very few participate in nonagricultural wage labor. Significant long-distance rural-rural migration occurred during armed conflicts in the 1970's and as part of state-led resettlement schemes during the droughts of the 1980's. However, subsequent governments placed significant restrictions on rural-urban migration, and current rates of migration and urbanization are low (Berhanu & White, 2000;World Bank, 2005).\",\n",
       "  'ANALYSIS': 'To investigate the effects of drought on mobility, we conducted an event history analysis through several steps as described below. First, we used the survey data described above to build a person-year dataset containing multiple measures of mobility. Second, we used aggregated household-level reports of drought and satellite measurements of rainfall to construct multiple measures of community-level drought. Third, we constructed several control variables at individual, household and community levels to account for other influences on mobility. Fourth, we examined the effects of drought on mobility while controlling for other factors by using multivariate event history models. Finally, we conducted an analysis of attrition among individuals in the panel.',\n",
       "  '(a) Person-year dataset': 'We first used the survey data described above to build a longitudinal dataset on individuals at risk of mobility. In the ERHS questionnaires, rosters collect information on both current household residents and previous household residents who have either departed or died, including on the timing and destination of departures. Using existing identifiers and a supplementary within-household age-sex match, we linked roster data on individuals resident in 1999 to roster data from the 2004 and 2009 surveys. We excluded one community (Sirbana Goditi), where individual identifiers were inconsistent across rounds, leaving 14 communities for the analysis. Individuals who were present in 1999 and were reported to have departed the origin household in 2004 or 2009 were considered to be movers. 2 We refer to these individuals as movers rather than migrants because some moved only a short distance, as described below. Consistent with previous studies (Berhanu & White, 2000;Ezra & Kiros, 2001), mobility occurred overwhelmingly among individuals aged 15-39 during the study period who were not the head of household or spouse of the head in 1999, and this population was defined to be at risk of mobility.\\nIndividuals not at risk of mobility were excluded from the analysis, as were those died in the interval, departed the household before age 15, or were lost to follow-up after 1999 (see (e) Attrition). A small additional number were excluded who had missing data on the timing of mobility. Following these exclusions, the dataset contains 1,667 adult men and 1,454 adult women at risk of mobility, of whom 702 men and 711 women departed the household. This individual-level dataset was then converted into a person-year dataset in which each case is a year in the life of a person at risk for mobility. Individuals enter the dataset in 1999 or when they turn 15 years old, and leave the dataset when they depart the household, turn 40 years old, or are censored at data collection in 2009. Men contribute 9,268 person-years to the dataset and women contribute 7,435 person-years. The annual rate of mobility for men was 7.6% for men and 9.6% for women.\\nIn addition to the dichotomous measure of mobility defined above, mobility was decomposed into two multinomial outcomes based on distance and motivation. Firstly, movers were classified as (1) having remained with the district (i.e., woreda) versus (2) having moved outside of the district. Men made 411 moves within the district and 284 outside the district, whereas women made 457 within-district moves and 247 out-of-district moves. Data on the distance of moves were missing for seven men and seven women. Secondly, movers were classified as (1) moving to initiate or search for employment (i.e., labor mobility), (2) moving in association with marriage (either to the spouse\\'s origin household or to an independent household), or (3) making other kinds of moves, which were primarily for schooling or to live with other family members. Men made 226 labor-related moves, 266 marriage-related moves, and 206 other moves. Women made 108, 439, and 161 of these types of moves, respectively. Data on the motivation of moves were missing for four men and three women. For both men and women, local moves were primarily for marriage (60% of local moves by men, 75% by women) followed by \"other\" motivations (27% by men, 21% by women). For women, distant moves were also most commonly for marriage (39%), followed by work (35%), but among men distant moves were primarily made for work (60%), followed by \"other\" reasons (32%).',\n",
       "  '(b) Measures of drought': \"To examine the influences of drought on mobility, we constructed three measures of drought using the household survey data and satellite data on rainfall. Our primary measure of drought, drawing on the household survey, is the proportion of households in the community that reported exposure to a drought in the previous year (t À 1), multiplied by 10 to produce a score that ranges from 1 to 10. Thus the mean value of 1.41 can be interpreted as 14.1% of households reporting a drought (Table 1). This measure draws on households' detailed knowledge of local environmental conditions. Additionally, by aggregating this measure to the community level, we construct a continuous measure of drought intensity and avoid the potential endogeneity of household drought reports to response strategies. Reported drought peaks in 2002 and 2008, with considerable variation in intensity across communities, which is consistent with other reports of drought intensity (EMDAT, 2010) and with the dispersed locations and varying climates of the 14 study communities. Given that most rain falls in the latter part of the Ethiopian year and mobility can occur at any time of year, we select the previous year's rainfall (i.e., a one year lag) as the primary specification, but as described below we also relax this assumption to allow multiple temporal lags as well as nonlinear effects.\\nTo confirm the robustness of the effects of reported drought, we also test the effects of two additional community-level measures of drought incorporating direct measures of rainfall. As complete data were not available for weather stations near the study communities, we instead draw on satellite measures of rainfall from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) dataset, which provides global daily precipitation values at 1°resolution from 1997 to 2009 3 (White, Hoogenboom, Stackhouse, & Hoell, 2008). These data were linked to the study communities using Global Positioning System points collected in the field. Three pairs of nearby communities were located in the same cells and thus received identical values. We summed rainfall values for July-October, 4 the primary agricultural season, and then transformed these annual totals into a normalized index ranging from 0 to 10 that increases with drought, 5 which we refer to as the rainfall deficit. The mean value of this measure is 5.06, and can be interpreted as representing rainfall at 94% of the community median. This measure is positively correlated with reported drought at r = 0.29 with p < 0.001.\\nFinally, we also develop a third measure to address the potential limitations of both reported drought, which could reflect community-specific perception biases, and the rainfall deficit, which ignores the timing of rainfall within the rainy season. To do this we created a household-year dataset and used logistic regression to predict household's reports of drought as a function of community fixed effects and monthly rainfall totals for the previous two years, allowing for a lag in the perception of drought (results available upon request). The value predicted by this model, which we refer to as predicted drought, can be interpreted as the mean level of reported drought expected in the community based on recent rainfall and on stable community factors such as the historical climate. This measure thus captures the cross-community relationship between the timing of rainfall and perceived drought, but is free of community-year specific factors that could have biased the perception of particular droughts (i.e., an unsuccessful collective response). Predicted drought is highly correlated with reported drought (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and has the same unit of measurement.\",\n",
       "  '(c) Control variables': 'To account for other factors that might influence mobility, we also construct several control variables at individual, household, and community scales in order to capture their previously described effects on mobility (Table 1) (White & 138 WORLD DEVELOPMENT Lindstrom 2005). Time-invariant controls, measured in 1999, include whether the individual was a child of the household head, whether the household head was female, whether the head was an ethnic minority, whether a parent of the head was important to village social life, whether the head had formal schooling, the size of the household, the number of movers sent by the household between 1994 and 1999, agricultural land area, and the number of livestock owned by the household. These variables measure access to resources, economic and social status, and social networks in and outside of the community. Time-varying individual-level controls include age of the individual and whether the individual had children. The latter serves as a time-varying measure of marital status as a marital history was not collected. To account for other community-level shocks that might be correlated with drought, we include time-varying measures of exposure to the four most commonly reported shocks other than drought (constructed in the same way as reported drought): exposure to flooding, problems with agricultural or animal pests, problems with access to agricultural inputs (including high prices), and problems selling agricultural products (including low prices).',\n",
       "  '(d) Event history models': 'To test the effects of drought on mobility while controlling for other factors, we estimate a series of discrete-time event history models (Allison, 1984). These models are appropriate to examine exposure over time to a single risk (dichotomous model) or to a mutually exclusive set of risks (multinomial model). The multinomial model includes one equation for each multinomial outcome beyond the reference category, which is no mobility. To account for baseline differences in mobility across communities, we include community fixed effects. We also include year fixed effects to account for changes in the national context and for artifacts arising from the timing of the surveys. 6  In the multinomial model the log odds of experiencing a mobility event of type r relative to no mobility (event s) are given by log\\np rit p sit ¼ a rt þ a rc þ b r X it\\nwhere p rit is the odds of mobility of type r for individual i in year t, p sit is the odds of no mobility, a rt is the baseline hazard of mobility of type r in year t, a rc is the baseline hazard of mobility of type r in community c, X it is a vector of predictor variables for individual i in year t, b r is a vector of parameters for the effects of the independent variables on mobility of type r, and the types of mobility, r, are (1) within-district and out-of-district, and (2) labor, marriage and other. In the dichotomous version of this model, all forms of mobility are considered jointly. All models include corrections for clustering at the level of the community to account for the nonindependence of households in the same community and the use of community-level predictors (Angeles, Guilkey, & Mroz, 2005). For presentation, we exponentiate the coefficients of this model to produce odds ratios, which can be interpreted as the multiplicative effects of a unit increase in the predictor on the odds of the outcome relative to the reference outcome (i.e., no mobility). Due to the inclusion of fixed effects for the community and year, these coefficients can be interpreted as comparing two individuals who are exposed to the same baseline community context as well as the same changing national context.\\nTo fully explore the effects of drought using this approach, we estimate several dichotomous and multinomial models of mobility, always for men and women separately. First we estimate a simple dichotomous model incorporating the reported drought measure. Second we expand this model by allowing interactions between reported drought and the individual and household-level controls, testing whether drought effects differ across subpopulations beyond men and women. Third, we return to the primary specification and estimate two multinomial models to examine how the effects of reported drought differ across the five types of mobility described above. Fourth, to test the robustness of these results, we reestimate the multinomial models with a variety of alternative specifications of drought. These include multiple temporal lags, nonlinear effects, and incorporation of the rainfall deficit and predicted drought measures described above. Finally, we use the nonlinear specification to estimate predicted probabilities of mobility under different drought conditions, providing an alternative estimate of the magnitude of drought effects on mobility.',\n",
       "  '(e) Attrition': 'A common problem in studies using panel data is attrition or loss to follow-up. In our case, mobility of individuals does not represent a loss to follow-up as departures are reported by remaining household members. However, attrition did occur in the form of the departure of entire households, individual mobility that was not reported, and miscoding of individual identifiers across rounds. Among individuals in the 1999 data who were at risk of mobility, 16% could not be linked to data from the 2004 and/or the 2009 rounds and were thus lost to follow-up. Among those lost to follow-up, 49% were part of whole households lost to follow-up, likely to due to mobility of the entire household.\\nTo examine whether loss to follow-up is likely to bias our estimates of the effects of drought, we estimated logit models of individual and household-level attrition as influenced by baseline characteristics, community fixed effects, and (for individual attrition) the number of droughts reported by the household during the study period 7 (results available upon request). Household attrition (i.e., the loss of an entire household) increased with education of the head and decreased with household size, consistent with the departure of small, well-educated households, but was not influenced by other baseline characteristics. Individual attrition (i.e., the loss of an individual from a remaining household) was lower for children of the head and higher from larger households, consistent with both mobility and miscoding of individual identifiers, but was not influenced by other baseline characteristics. Individual attrition was also not influenced by the total number of droughts reported by the household for the 2000-2008 period, suggesting that our estimates of the effects of drought are not likely to be biased by attrition.',\n",
       "  'RESULTS': \"Below we describe the results of the event history analysis of mobility, considering in turn each of the five modeling steps described above. We comment on the effects of control variables when of interest but, consistent with the goals of the study, focus our interpretation on the effects of drought.\\n(a) The dichotomous model Table 2 presents the results of the simple dichotomous model of mobility. For both men and women, the effects of control variables are jointly highly significant and consistent with previous studies of internal migration in the developing world. Mobility peaked at ages 30-49 for men and ages 25-29 for women. For both groups mobility was lower for children of the household head and individuals with children, reflecting stronger ties to the origin household. Mobility also increased with household size, indicating a crowding effect given that land and livestock resources are controlled. Additionally, men's mobility increased with the number of livestock and marginally decreased with pest problems, and women's mobility increased with problems obtaining agricultural inputs.\\nThe effect of drought on mobility was positive and highly significant (p = .002) for men, but negative and nonsignificant for women. For men, a 10% rise in the proportion of the community reporting drought was matched by a 10% increase in the odds of mobility. This result is consistent with a simple model in which drought serves as a push factor for migration, particularly for men who are the primary labor migrants. Below, however, we complicate this story by allowing the effects of drought to differ between subpopulations and across different types of mobility.\",\n",
       "  '(b) Interactions with drought': 'Table 2 also presents an expansion of the dichotomous model in which the effects of the individual and household-level controls are allowed to interact with drought, testing whether drought effects are the same across subpopulations. The interactions are jointly highly significant for both men and women. For women, the drought effect remains nonsignificant for the reference category but becomes significantly negative for women with children. The drought effect also becomes significantly larger for women aged 30-49 and for women in households with a female head, as well as smaller in households where a parent of the head was socially important in the village. For men, the main drought effect remains positive and significant but becomes smaller as household land area increases. These results suggest a more complex story in which certain groups are more affected by drought, particularly women with children, who move less often, and men from land-poor households, who move more often. In indicating that land-poor households are more vulnerable to climate-induced mobility, these results are also consistent with a growing literature on vulnerability to environmental change (Adger, 2006).',\n",
       "  '(c) Multinomial models': \"Table 3 presents an additional extension of the dichotomous model by allowing the effects to differ across categories of mobility defined by distance and motivation. Due to space limitations we do not comment in detail on the effects of control variables but observe that overall they are consistent with expectations. Notable results for men include increases in local and marriage mobility with age and livestock, and increases in labor mobility with minority ethnicity and migrant networks. Notable results for women include decreases in labor mobility with land and livestock, and increases in labor mobility with minority ethnicity and problems obtaining agricultural inputs.\\nThe multinomial approach reveals that the positive effects of drought on men's mobility are significant only for longdistance mobility (i.e., migration) and labor mobility, the odds 140 WORLD DEVELOPMENT of which increase 18% and 13%, respectively, with a 10% increase in the proportion reporting drought. This result suggests that men are responding to drought with long-distance and labor mobility in order to supplement household income, consistent with expectations. The effects of drought on women's mobility remain nonsignificant for most outcomes but become strongly negative for marriage mobility. This result suggests that, consistent with ethnographic reports ( Ezra, 2001), women's marriage mobility is delayed in times of drought to limit potentially high bride-wealth expenses associated with marriage (Fafchamps & Quisumbing, 2005b). That this effect is significant for women's marriage mobility but not men's can be explained by the fact that, as noted above, their marriage mobility commonly occurs at different times: women first move to the home of their father-in-law, and the couple later forms an independent household. This result provides an interesting counter-example to the dominant narrative of environmentally-induced migration given that mobility decreases with drought.\",\n",
       "  '(d) Alternative specifications of drought': 'In Table 4, to test the robustness of these findings, we present four alternative specifications of the drought effects on the two multinomial outcomes. Overall, the results indicate the effects described above are quite robust to alternative specifications and measures of drought. Alternative specification 1 allows a nonlinear effect of reported drought on mobility. Reported drought values greater than 2.0 were considered to be moderate drought and values greater than 4.0 were considered to be severe drought, corresponding to the 70th and 90th percentiles, respectively, of the reported drought distribution at the community-year level. This specification reveals that the positive effects of drought on men\\'s labor and long-distance mobility are primarily due to the consequences of severe drought, as expected given the right-skewed distribution of reported drought. For women, however, moderate drought has a larger negative effect on marriage migration than severe drought, and moderate drought also significantly reduces short-distance moves. These results suggest that the desire to lower the number of consumers in the origin household might partially counteract the desire to limit marriage-related expenses (perhaps to less-desirable spouses) in times of severe drought.\\nAlternative specification 2 returns to the linear specification of drought but allows effects of reported drought in year of mobility (year t) as well as from the previous year (year t À 1). (We also tested for effects of drought from years prior to year t À 1, but these were consistently nonsignificant and are not shown.) Specification 2 reveals that the significant positive effects of drought on men\\'s labor mobility extend into the year of mobility, but that other effects in year t are marginally significant or nonsignificant. Alternative specifications 3-4 replace reported drought with the rainfall deficit and predicted drought, respectively, but retain the year t and year t À 1 specification to allow lags in how deficits in rainfall are perceived as drought. Overall, the effects of these two measures of drought are qualitatively similar to those of reported drought, with a few notable differences. The positive effects of drought on men\\'s labor and long-distance mobility occur primarily in year t instead of year t À 1, which may reflect mental \"backdating\" of perceived droughts to include earlier dry periods. For women, the previously nonsignificant effect of drought on short-distance mobility becomes significant and a positive effect of drought on (relatively rare) labor migration becomes evident, but the negative effect of drought on marriage mobility is robust to these changes.\\n(e) Predicted probabilities of mobility Finally, in Table 5 we present predicted probabilities of mobility derived from the nonlinear model described above (alternative specification 1). These values provide a clearer view of the magnitude of differences in mobility under varying drought conditions. For men, this analysis reveals that, as conditions change from no drought to severe drought, the rate of total mobility increases from 5.7% to 9.8% of individuals per year, the rate of labor mobility increases from 1.4% to 2.6%, and the rate of long-distance mobility increases from 1.7% to 4.8% (i.e., nearly triples). Among women, a change from no drought to moderate drought reduces total mobility from 8.3% to 5.5%, short-distance mobility from 4.9% to 2.9%, and marriage mobility from 4.8% to 2.6%. Thus the magnitudes of drought effects on migration are relatively large, though not large enough to depopulate communities as envisioned under worse-case scenarios.',\n",
       "  'CONCLUSIONS': \"Our results provide robust evidence that drought has important consequences for population mobility in rural highland Ethiopia. Among men, labor-related movements and migration out of the district more than doubled under severe drought, with total mobility reaching 10% of adult men per year. Men from land-poor households were most vulnerable to these effects, presumably due to a lesser ability to cope with drought. These results support the common observation that mobility serves as a key coping strategy following drought, as well as the frequent assumption that the poor are most vulnerable to these effects. However, the results for women significantly complicate this story. Women's short-distance and marriage-related mobility were reduced by half under moderate drought, reflecting a decreased ability to finance wedding expenses and new household formation. These results emphasize the importance of nonlinear environmental effects on mobility, as well as the potential for environmental shocks to reduce instead of increase population mobility. Together these results contribute to a pattern emerging from the small number of previous demographic studies of environmentally-induced population mobility: Adverse environmental conditions often increase mobility, but not always. Instead, consistent with migration theory, mobility remains selective with important barriers to participation, and adverse conditions can actually reduce mobility by undermining the necessary resources. The generality of this hybrid narrative of environmentally-induced population mobility is now sup-ported by several quantitative studies (e.g., Gray, 2009;Halliday, 2006;Henry et al., 2004;Massey et al., 2010), and should give policy-makers pause before they accept the common narrative of inevitable large-scale displacement occurring under future climate change (e.g., Myers, 2002;Warner et al., 2009). Regarding Ethiopia specifically, a warmer climate with more variable rainfall would likely accelerate the effects described here, but current models project higher rainfall for highland Ethiopia under future climate change (De Wit & Stankiewicz, 2006).\\nThis study also has important implications for research methods in the field of environmentally-induced migration. Publications in this field are characterized by a very high ratio of review and theoretical papers to empirical analyses, with the former often arguing that there is no generalizable methodology for testing environmental influences on population mobility (e.g., Laczko & Aghazarm, 2009). We disagree and hope that other investigators will take note of the approach described here and apply it in new contexts, improving our ability to generalize. We use data from a unique long-term panel survey with specific questions about environmental shocks and supplement with additional geospatial data, but important progress can also be made using shorter-duration panel surveys (e.g., Halliday, 2006) and specially designed retrospective surveys of migration (e.g., Henry et al., 2004). In many contexts, however, new data collection will be required, and we hope that these concerns will inform a new generation of longitudinal surveys that increasingly take environmental factors into account. NOTES 1. We use the term migration when referring exclusively to long-distance moves and the term population mobility when referring collectively to all changes of residence.\\n2. This definition excludes as movers individuals who departed and then returned prior to the subsequent survey round as data their movements was not collected. However, only 5% of movers who departed prior to 2004 had returned by 2009, suggesting that the number of returnees missed by this definition is low.\\n3. At the time of preparation, rainfall data were not yet available for September and October of 2009. We interpolated July-October rainfall for 2009 by dividing the July and August rainfall by its mean proportion of the July-October total.\\n4.

       "  'INTRODUCTION': \"In March 2008.empirical investigations were conducted in two palm groves of the Middle Drâa Valley (M'hamid and Ktaoua) on the fringes of the Sahara desert in Morocco to test the EACH-FOR hypotheses with regard to the relation between environmental degradation and migration. This report presents and analyses the fieldwork findings (Chapter 3). The case study methods and the selection of the case study site are discussed in Chapter 2. To understand and analyse the results of the fieldwork, background knowledge on the socio-historical, socio-economic and environmental contexts is indispensable. This background information is presented in this chapter. The first subsection sketches the physical and human contexts of the case study area, while the subsequent one presents some information on the Moroccan migration context. The third section of this chapter describes some salient environmental problems and changes in the case study area.\",\n",
       "  'Synthesis of context': '',\n",
       "  'Physical context': \"Morocco is situated at the northwest of the African continent (See Figure 1; and Figure 4 in the Annex). In terms of topography, mountains occupy a large part of the country.  The country has a differentiated Mediterranean climate, with oceanic influences prevailing in the northwest, while in the south and southeast of the High Atlas and Anti Atlas Mountain ranges the continental, Saharan influences dominate. This results in a huge bioclimatic diversity. Given these geophysical conditions, almost all biological life is concentrated in the northern part and in the oases along the rivers (Oueds in Arabic) and water ponds in the southern part of the country. The oases of Tafilalet (, along the river Ziz; see Figure 1) and of the Drâa (also spelled Dra or Draa), constitute Morocco's most important palm groves.\\nIn the Drâa Valley a river of the same name (Oued Drâa) flows from the Atlas Mountains southwards to Ktaoua and from there westwards to the Atlantic Ocean. The Upper Drâa is part of the province of Ouarzazate. The middle part of the water catchment is part of the province of Zagora and consists of 6 palm groves (Mezguita, Tinzouline, Ternate, Fezouate, Ktaoua and M'hamid; See figure 2). The Lower Drâa, after M'hamid, is predominantly a dry river bed. The river is lost in the desert sand and has not reached the Atlantic Ocean near Tan-Tan for decades. The former lake Iriqui (or Lac Irigui / Iriki) is now a desiccated salt pan. Ktaoua 3 and M'hamid 4 constitute the southernmost palm groves of the middle Drâa Valley. They are located on the edge of the Sahara with an arid climate, and constantly threatened by drought, salinity, sand advancement and locust invasions.  The palm grove Ktaoua (or Ktawa) is also referred to by the name of the Commune (= municipality) Tagounite. The two names are used in this report to refer to the same palm grove. The rural centre Tagounite, that hosts the seat of the Commune was founded in the last administrative division of 1992 4 M'hamid (or Mhamid) is also known as M'hamid El Ghizlane (El Ghizlane = of the antelopes)..\",\n",
       "  'Socio-historical and political context': 'Because of its strategic position on a Saharan caravan route between the Sahara and the north of Morocco, and due to the importance of its resources, the Drâa Valley has been highly attractive to people of various origins throughout its history. This resulted in a considerable ethnic mixing. The Draoua 5 (the black population), supposed to be the natives, constitute the core of the local population. Since the 13 th century, in order to protect against incursions by the Arab Bedouin tribes of Maâqil, the indigenous peoples 5 Draoua (plural of Draoui): derived from the word Dra. The word means the populations living in the Valley of the Drâa. By extension, the concept refers to all black populations of Saharan or sub-Saharan origin (also called Haratin), who are generally known for being attached to agricultural land without possessing it.  called on the help of the Ait Atta 6 as well as the Ait Sedrate 7 for protection. The first came from the Sahara and Saghro regions, the latter likely came from the north. The protection given by these tribes to the local population was often exchanged for a part of the territory, goods and sovereignty.\\nIn the same context, a number of brotherhoods (zaouias or zawiyas) moved into the valley. The Chorfa (plural of Cherif; descendants of the Prophet) are marabouts affiliated with these zaouias and they played the role of mediators, social administrators and religious preachers. Due to their status as social and spiritual leaders, the Chorfa were often able to avoid manual labour.and lived off of the offerings and the goods left by the faithful pilgrims.\\nThe Jewish merchants and craftsmen also have marked the history of the valley. According Ch. De Foucauld (1888: 295), the palm grove of Ktaoua had two mellahs 8 while the palm grove of M\\'hamid had one mellah. In 1936In , approximately 1169 Jews lived in the two palm groves.\\nFurthermore, in the 1960s the Sahrawi nomad Arabic tribe of Aaribs, that habitually crossed the Sahara with their camels and goats, were forced to settle in the oases due to the 1963 border conflict between Morocco and Algeria.\\nSituated in this ethnically mixed valley, the palm groves of Ktaoua and M\\'hamid therefore inherited a very diverse socio-ethnic and hierarchical structure. The Chorfa marabouts are at the top of the pyramid, followed by the Imazigh (white) nomadic tribes and at the base are the Haratin (Draoui or Issoukiyn, the black oasis dwellers) and the Jews. The linguistic map follows the same contours and complex situation: Arabic, Berber 9 , and Hebrew.\\nSocial promotion stimulated by schooling, internal and international migration, and the presence and growth of urban centres (of Tagounite and M\\'hamid) contributed to the alleviation of this hierarchy based on social status. Nevertheless, we can still notice the features of this hierarchy consciously and subconsciously in the community. For example, each social class has its own neighbourhood mosque within the villages (ksars 10 ). Its traces are also 6\\nThe Ait Atta constituted a tribe or a confederation of mainly nomadic tribes that arrived from the Sahara in this region. They are organized in confederations on a territory that spreads up from the Tafilalet, to the High Atlas and to the plains of Tadla and El Haouz in the north of the Atlas. NB: Ait means \"people of\", thus in this combination: people who trace their ancestry to a man named Atta.',\n",
       "  '7': 'The Ait Sedrat tribe is a makhzen tribe (makhzen is a term used for the governing elite in Morocco), which migrated to the south to protect the Draoua. In the Drâa valley they live nowadays in the palm grove of Mezguita.',\n",
       "  '8': \"Mellah indicates a separate Jewish quarter or neighbourhood. The two mellahs of the palm grove are located in the ksars (fortified villages) of Beni haioun and Bni Sbih. 9 Instead of Berber, we use Amazigh language. Amazigh (plural: Imazigh) when referring to people may signify 'white' or pale skinned people in opposition to the black population of Haratin. The Ait Atta and Ait Sedrate are both of Amazigh origin. 10 Ksars (or ksur/qsur, plural of qsar): villages in the Atlas and southern of the Atlas; traditionally fortified villages of attached houses and collective granaries constructed from adobe, but the term is also used for modern villages in this region. noticeable in the geopolitical space (administrative divisions) 11 . These divisions come to the surface in daily life in concerns such as management of water, land tenure and community housing and especially during events such as elections, weddings and cultural events.\",\n",
       "  'Demographic overview': \"There are several specific factors of relevance to the demographic development of the two palm groves area. The two palm groves are near the Moroccan-Algerian border and in the early sixties, they, especially M'hamid,were the battleground between Morocco and Algeria (the Sands War of 1963) 12 . This resulted in the departure of many families, but also the arrival and installation of several military contingents. Furthermore, the departure of the Jewish community took place at the same time. 13 Moreover, it is difficult to count the nomadic population. They are not always included in the census. Notably, the severe drought in the early 1980s had a very negative impact on the livestock husbandry, resulting in an accelerated settling process of nomads (Table 1).  ), 1960 -1982 -1994 However, while the drought had negative impacts on the vegetation and wildlife, they have stimulated desert tourism. The M'hamid palm grove became an important tourist destination for lovers of adventure tourism, camel riding, hunting etc. and it offers nowadays a range of hotels and Bedouin camps for these purposes. The nomad festival of 20 to 23 March each year for example, is an event organized to attract tourists. However, despite the increase in tourism, the population of both palm groves continues to decrease (Table 2).\",\n",
       "  '11': 'During the communal division of 1992, the Ktaoua palm grove was divided into two municipalities or communes: the commune of Tagounit whose population is in majority composed of Draoua and the commune of Ktaoua with the dominance of Ait Atta.',\n",
       "  '12': 'The border disputes between Morocco and Algeria are still unsolved, and part of the border near the case study sites is still disputed. The borders between both countries have been closed several times (after the Sands War, after Morocco\\'s Green March to the Western Sahara 1976Sahara -1988Sahara , and since 1994)). Fighting terrorism, but also the dispute over the Western Sahara are main motives for the tensions between both countries. See: \\'Chronology: Border disputes highlight Morocco-Algeria rivalry\", Reuters. UK, Dec. 3, 2007. http ) 1960 ;1971 ;1982 ;1994 and2004 ;National Statistical Office, Rabat. A comparative analysis of the figures recorded between 1994 and 2004 shows a clear decline in the population of the two palm groves if compared to the provincial and the national level (Table 3). Between 1971 and 2004 the two palm groves had lost a total of approximately 3666 people, which means that every year on average 111 persons left. If the same comparison is made solely for the rural population between 1982 and 2004, the result is more disturbing. In fact, M\\'hamid passed from 8671 to 7764 inhabitants and Ktaoua from 24,780 to 17,553 with a loss of 907 and 7227 inhabitants respectively.\\nThe indexes of fertility in the year 2004 (3.4 for Ktaoua and 2.9 for M\\'hamid) show that the rate of natural increase is still very high. The age distribution of the population shows that the ratio of young people, compared with the total and the rural population of Morocco, in general, also remains high (Table 4). During the administrative division of 1992, the palm grove of Ktaoua was divided into two rural communes or municipalities. The commune of Ktaoua and the Commune of Tagounit. The commune of Tagounite consists of 21 villages and a small emerging rural centre, the commune of Ktaoua consists of 42 villages. The commune of M\\'hamid consists of 15 villages (ksars).',\n",
       "  \"Source: Recensement Général de la Population et de l'Habitat (RGPH) 2004\": 'The proportion of youth below 15 years is almost 40% of the total population. The proportion of working age people barely exceeds 52%. This shows the heavy burden on the working age population, which is exacerbated by the high rate of illiteracy (almost 49%) and the low rate of the labour activity (20.5 %).\\nAs will be argued later in this report, the sharp decline of the rural population in the palm groves appears to be related to the severe drought experienced in the early 1980s and the negative effects of the construction of the El Mansour Eddahbi dam (1972) on the environment, particularly agriculture. The decline of the rural population is also related to the increase of needs driven by the process of opening of the oasis to the wider world due to migration, the media, urbanization, and tourism.',\n",
       "  'Economic context': \"The oasis agriculture and forms of adaptation\\nThe oasis economy is closely linked with the agricultural sector, which has been a form of adaptation for centuries. The oasis area that is constituted by the palm groves of Ktaoua and M'hamid contains two main parts that are economically and legally differentiated: the oasis or cultivable part, and the part outside the oasis, mainly reserved for collective rangeland for extensive livestock husbandry. Agricultural soils form a strip of land in the wadi (river bed) area. The new or old land abandoned by river courses is covered with loamy soil or sandy loam and forms a green strip along the river. Outside that green band, the land is collective and exploited mainly as rangeland. Only exceptionally, in rainy years, can the fertile flat infiltration basin (maâders) be exploited for seasonal cultures.\\nIn the arid climate of the area, no agriculture can be practiced without irrigation. Irrigation water is essential for the constitution of the soils and for the exploitation of the fields. Because of its rarity, water is subject to a rigorous sharing scheme. Allocation is decided on the basis of ones participation in the mobilization of resources and on the basis of socioeconomic status. Water can also be individually owned if located on ones property. Community management of water is a fundamental element of the oasis civilization (Ouhajou 1996;Ait Hamza 2002;Bencherifa and Popp 1990). Thus, despite the construction of a large dam upstream, the traditional division of water and land rights continues to paralyze the production structures in this region.\\nThe fragmentation and the dispersion of fields constitute the dominant character of land ownership. Micro properties reign in the oasis; the area of holdings ranges between 0.5 and 5 hectares. Under the combined effects of old divisions and demographic pressures, more than 80% of the fellahs (farmers) own less than one hectare. Individual plots of farms (households) are usually small and scattered about different sites of arable land in a palm grove. The number of parcels per farm is between 1 and 8 (See Table 5). The few farms that still have a respectable size are the newly established ones on the communal lands with water pumps. The establishment of these new plots in the oasis occurs by de facto privatization of communal or village lands. It is often a cause for disputes between sedentary and nomadic people. The trees, notably the palm trees, due to their economic and social importance, can also constitute a separate property title. A date palm tree can be owned by several tenants (inherited or purchased).\\nProduction techniques remained traditional in general. Mechanization, given the very small size of the properties, the scattered plots and the constant presence of trees in the fields, is almost absent. Thus people tend to practice farming based on mixed farming in which trees and especially date palm trees are most crucial. The palm trees are considered as umbrellas that offer various crops underneath a favourable microclimate for their development. Below the palm trees are a variety of fruit trees (like olive trees, pomegranates, figs, almonds, peaches, and apricots), and below these are a variety of seasonal crops, such as cereals, vegetables, fodder, and vegetables. Thus agriculture and vegetation are organized by levels.\\nIn such a context of scarcity and natural determinism, there are few products that are targeted for the markets. Only the dates and henna fall into a circuit of local and national markets. Agricultural production is mainly for home consumption and the region depends largely on imported products from the plains and plateaus of northern Morocco and even from abroad.\\nDue to the significance and the magnitude of physical constraints, irrigated agriculture is mainly based on human ingenuity and adaptability. In order to persist, the oasis people have developed strategies based on diversification of resources and soils, as well as community risk management. Traditionally, people focused mainly on mobile cattle herding (transhumance) and commerce as income yielding activities supplementary to farming. Todaydue to the opening of the oasis and recurrent droughts -they are oriented towards migration and tourism as alternative complementary sources of income.\",\n",
       "  'Cattle breeding as pillar in a mixed rural economy': \"In an environment as austere as the one in the pre-Saharan regions, survival requires perseverance and resorting to adaptation strategies. Coping strategies are mainly based on the diversification of resources to manage scarcity and risks. For example, mixed cropping; diversification of fodder resources (weeding fields, forage cultures, extensive cattle farming, etc.); complementarity between the sedentary lifestyle and transhumance; collective community herding; a nomadic lifestyle of part of the populations; complementarity of lands (different types of cultivation on different types of soils; private property and communal grazing lands); and diversification of types of livestock (camels, sheep, goats).\\nMutual community aid is a necessary asset. Traditionally, the individual as such was not likely to withstand the natural hazards. The extended family, the lineage, the fraction, tribe or confederation of tribes are all institutions that help ensure that the individual meets his/her needs.\\nThe colonial rule which substituted community administration has significantly impacted social organization and land distribution. The division of the territory, formerly based on the tribe and its mobilisation capacity, became determined by the political stakes of a foreign entity. The result was an increasing level of exposure of the individual to socio-economic and natural hazards. The former nomadic populations were the first victims of these transformations. Their settlement became inevitable.\\nLocal people, who are ethnically diverse, developed different responses to the occupations. The Ait Atta15 and the Aribs (or Aaribs) were mostly nomadic people. The first engaged in raising goats and camels. They had access to summer pastures in the High Atlas and winter pastures close to the Jbel Saghro Mountains and on the Saharan fringes. The Aribs had the tradition of criss-crossing the large Saharan ranges with their camels before they settled in M'hamid after border fights between Morocco and Algeria in 1963. The Draoui16 are mostly attached to the land practice only sedentary farming. Their living conditions have greatly deteriorated as a result of recurrent droughts. In the oasis economy, livestock in general and sheep in particular, are part of the adaptation strategy. They are also an essential element for agriculture due to the production of manure. Sedentary livestock herding is linked to the presence of forage crops (alfalfa) and food derived from agriculture (straw, leaves, herbs, etc.) The dmane race of sheep is widespread and a unique asset of oases livestock farming. Goats are rather a specialty of transhumance movements from the peaks of the High Atlas, in summer, to the confines of the Sahara in the winter. The grazing rights are collective and administered by communal institutions.\\nBecause of the harsh climate, cow ranching is difficult. The local breed is most prevalent. However, the milk and meat production of this local breed is very low. The enormous need for water and food for improved breeds of cows hinder their introduction near to the desert (in M'hamid).\\nThe camels are one of the species well adapted to the bioclimatic conditions of the Saharan and pre-Saharan areas. Besides their importance for the local population for their supply of milk, meat, wool and leather, they are the most used means of transportation in these areas. According to specialists, the abandonment of this animal can be considered as the end of the nomadic way of life and as a form of adaptation to the local circumstances. The camels are more and more used as an element of attraction for the tourist caravan hiking trips, especially in M'hamid. Thus, despite the changes that were imposed by the new circumstances, livestock breeding remains an important activity.\",\n",
       "  'Brief overview of migration processes': \"Morocco is a main source country of migrants especially for Europe. During the colonial era , there were already migration flows from Morocco to France. In the period of guest worker recruitment from 1962-1972, the magnitude of migration expanded dramatically while at the same time the countries of destination diversified. After the 1973 oil crisis most migrants did not return. Instead, massive family reunification followed in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by processes of family formation in the 1990s (children of guest workers marrying partners from their parent's home countries). In the 1990s and after, as a consequence of the restrictive immigration policies in Europe, the number of undocumented migrants from Morocco to new South European destinations such as Spain and Italy increased. In 2004, the largest population of Moroccan descent could be found in France, followed by Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and Germany (De Haas 2007a). Since the mid 1990s, Morocco has developed into a transit migration country for a diverse group of asylum seekers and labour migrants from sub-Saharan Africa countries.\\nEmigration from Morocco is not evenly distributed over its regions. Main traditional regions of emigration since the start of the guest worker recruitment in the 1960s are the Northern Rif region, the Sous Valley and Agadir, and some southern Oases in the province of Ouarzazate (See Annex, Figure 4 for the main traditional and recent international migration zones). Emigrants from the last mentioned Oases region came mainly from oases north of the Drâa Valley, namely: the Dadès Valley, Todgha and Figuig (De Haas 2003: 109-112). There has also been some international migration from the Drâa Valley in the past, but not a significant amount. For example, in the beginning of the 1960s, recruitment agents from French coal mines crisscrossed the Moroccan countryside. The most famous one, Felix Mora, was the originator of the migration of thousands of oasis residents in this region. During the last two decades, some new sending areas have emerged for international migration, in particular Khenifra in the Middle Atlas and south of Tangiers (De Haas 2003: 112-113).\\nAlthough international migration from Morocco is substantial, internal migration has always remained more important in numerical terms. Rural-tourban migration is significant, as is habitually the case in developing countries. In Morocco, this type of migration is traditionally directed to the big cities on the Atlantic coast. Internal migration processes have become more complex. Intra-regional migration processes and the migration to growing small and medium-sized provincial towns are becoming of increasing importance (De Haas 2003: 113 ff.). These processes are linked to the decline of the agricultural sector and the development of numerous centrally located villages into urban centres offering non-agricultural employment within the rural regions (De Haas 2003: 113). Internal migrants are attracted by the better job opportunities but also by better services and public infrastructure in these provincial towns. In our case study area of southern Morocco, Ouarzazate is an important growing town attracting migrants from the region. Internal migrants in Morocco tend to work as day labourers on construction sites, in retail or street trade, and other service jobs in urban centres. As agricultural labourers they mostly work in commercial agriculture in fertile areas on the Western coast, including the Sous valley, around Fes and Meknes and along the northern coast (De Haas 2003: 115).\\nEmigration from the marginal oases like the one in the Middle Drâa Valley (province of Zagora) is predominantly of an internal character in contrast to migration from some of the less marginal oases in the province of Ourzazate (De Haas 2003: 114-115) . Migration from the Middle Draa Valley, the palm groves such as M'hamid and Ktaoua is predominantly of an internal and temporal character. However, as will be demonstrated later in this report, there are signs of a shift towards international and more permanent migration.\",\n",

       "  'An arid and continental climate': 'The Valley of the Wadi Drâa (Wadi is a valley or (dry) riverbed) is located between the High Atlas mountains -with peaks over 4000 m high -in the north and the Saharan desert in the south. As a result of its local, the region is characterized by:\\n• high temperatures, especially between June and September (43 to 50 °C);\\n• strong thermal amplitudes (20 degrees in Tagounite)\\n• long hours of sunshine (between 3055 and 3078 hours/year)\\n• high rates of evapotranspiration (evaporation and plant transpiration) particularly during the summer. • scarcity and the high inter-annual variability in precipitation.\\nIn the Middle Drâa oasis there is a significant inter-annual and seasonal irregularity of rainfall, as well as a spatial decrease of rainfall from upstream to the downstream areas. Table 7 shows the inter-annual variability of rainfall; see Figure 2 for the locations of meteorological stations in Agd(e)z, Zagora and Tagounite. The Tagounite station located downstream -in the Ktaoua palm grove -records the largest differences (between 4 and 150 mm) with a very high frequency of years below the average (15 of 26). The wet periods are uncommon, while dry periods are characterized by their depth and frequency (1981-1982-1983 and 1984). The rain falls often in the form of concentrated aggressive showers.

The high temperatures, strong storms and sandstorms raging in the region exacerbate the situation.',\n",

       "  'Scarcity and salinity of surface water': 'The Drâa oasis is fed by the precipitation received in the peaks of the High Atlas. Despite the role the limestone bedrock of the Mountains plays in the regularity of the regime of the rivers, the bare hillsides and the steep slopes of the mountainous area cannot ensure a lasting and sustained supply of water to the basin because of a very high rate of surface run-off. The average flow recorded in the Oued Drâa in Zagora was 13.4 m 3 /s and the maximum that was ever recorded was in 1965 and reached 213 m 3 /s. However, in August of the same year, only 0.13 m 3 /s was recorded. The testimony reported by Ch. De Foucauld during his visit in the late 19th century, compared with the current reality, shows that the valley is experiencing an increasingly high frequency of dry periods and severe environmental degradation.\\nIn parallel to the increasing rarity of water, the rate of salinity is increasing as well. Thus, the oasis has become the theatre of many devastating disasters. 17',\n",
       "  'Advancement of the desert': 'The advancement of desert sand is not a new phenomenon, though its intensity and dimensions seem to gain alarming proportions nowadays. In fact, the evidence collected on the site agrees with the analysis of the aerial photos. The desert sand is advancing with big steps. Today, the phenomenon is of concern not only to the Saharan provinces, but all those surrounding provinces which are in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains (Figuig, Errachidia, Zagora, Tata and Guelmim, etc.). Advancing sands constitute a real threat for the poor rural population.

It is not uncommon to see in winter the river flooding the whole valley even till the walls of the Ksars. The water from the Oued Drâa, even of it is a little yellow, it is pleasant to drink.

       "  'The Bayoud disease': 'The bayoud is a fungus (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis) which attacks mainly palm trees. The fungus enters the tree by its roots and causes death once it and its toxins reach their terminal bud. The disease spread through the contact between healthy and infected roots. Infection can be spread as well through irrigation water and through soil. According to experts the bayoud disease has destroyed more than 2/3 of palm trees in Morocco (12 million trees) within a century. Investigation in 1981 by Djerbi in the Drâa Valley revealed 165,574 killed palm trees per each 2 million. Thus in most oases, more than half of the commercial date palm trees have been destroyed. The numbers of unproductive and poor quality palm trees are increasing. The disease has not only caused the loss of a basic element of food for the population (consumption is estimated to be 187 kg per head per year), but also the loss of a source of income and foreign currency. In addition it reduced tremendously the extension of annual crops protected by the palm trees (because palm trees offer a suitable microclimate for these crops) and accelerated the desertification process.\\nThe competent authorities recognized the importance of the threat to the palm groves, and began a fierce campaign to hinder the spread of the disease. The quarantine and incineration of infected palm were the most prevalent techniques. The selection of resistant cultivars and breeding from these bayoud-resistant, high quality varieties, in addition to putting into quarantine the infected areas, is seemingly the most promising strategy. The declaration of the area as an \"Oasis Du Sud Marocain\" Biosphere Reserve 18 will be able to preserve this heritage. Nevertheless, even today, losses from the effects of diseases, but also transplantation and transport of palm trees to cities for decorative purposes remains enormous.',\n",
       "  'Locust invasions': 'The oasis environment favours the multiplication of the homes and outbreaks of locusts. The oases of the south of Morocco has experienced a number of severe plagues of locusts, notably from 1942 to 1945, in 1950, in 1955, in 1958-1959, in 1987-1988 (Roy 2001) and in 2004. They arrive from the tropical zone and subsequently the swarms move towards the north up to the hillsides of the Atlas. This phenomenon recurs seasonally in particular during rainy years and typically in winter and spring seasons until the months of February -March. The insects devastate crops in entire regions.\\n18 See: http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=MOR+02&mode=all\\nThere is absence of significant means for control and fight against swarms of migrating locusts that have invaded, since the second half of February 200,4 not only the regions of Oued Drâa, Bouarfa and Tiznit, but also the cities of Essaouira and E Jjadida. After palm trees, argan trees and olive trees, the locust invasion is now at the gates of the large agricultural plains of the Kingdom, threatening the cereal harvest. (Maroc Hebdo International newspaper, issue no. 597 of 19-25 March, 2004. Destruction of vegetation by human activities in certain areas encourages the increase of the most arid habitats with which populations of locusts are associated. Furthermore, locust control operations cause enormous damage. The fragile desert or semi desert areas are often heavily affected by massive spraying of toxic products (the best known being DDT). Between 2003 and 2004, Morocco treated over 5 million hectares of land with insecticides. The quantity of pesticides used is estimated at 32,000 tons over a two-year period. (Luong-Skormand, Rachadi and Lecoq 1999). The environment and consequently the lives of humans, animals and plants, are endangered.\\nThe environmental threats to the Drâa Valley are summarized in Figure 3. Faced with the increasing water demand, to ensure a maximum degree of regular supply, the State built the Al Mansour Eddahbi 19 dam upstream from the oasis in 1972. This construction, built initially to regulate flows and ensure the irrigation of areas located downstream created many human and ecological problems, including:',\n",
       "  'Changing society, spatial organisation and the environment': '• Disruption to the feeding of the downstream water table ; \\n• Disruption to soil fertilization which was previously ensured naturally by the floods and the natural flow of water • Increase in soil salinity in downstream palm groves;\\n• Conflict with traditional irrigation system based on water rights, which is hampering the implementation of a modern system based on the needs of plants; • The irrigation technique based on submersion is being used without taking into consideration the scarcity of water; • The legal status of lands, waters and trees does not allow any operation of regrouping of lands and consequently any modernization of techniques 20 or of cultures. • The stopping of the natural flow of waters from the river resulted in the drying up of old lakes located downstream (Lake Iriki or Irigui) and consequently the disappearance of the related biological life.\\nParallel to this alarming environmental situation, the population which used to adapt to the geographical context has witnessed profound changes, due mainly to demographic growth, urbanization and to the pressures on resources. Notably, the last four decades of the last century witnessed a huge restructuring of the zone. The settlement of nomadic populations, encouraged by the Sands war between Morocco and Algeria, has been accelerated by recent developments. The following are some of the consequences this settlement has had on the socio-spatial situation:\\n• The settlement of nomads and the conquest of new agricultural lands on the edge of traditional oasis. The resort to water pumping as a means of irrigation is strongly encouraged by the remittances of migrants. • Unending conflicts between old oasis settlers and old nomads compelled to settle down, who claim the right to land, water and recognition. • The urbanization of the oases.\\nFacing the demographic pressure and its impact on resources that are already fragile, and facing the new needs generated by intensive contact with the outside world (the effect of media, the school, urbanization, and tourism), 19\\nThe capacity of the dam is 560 million m 3 of water. However, since its construction, it is rare that the dam exceeds 60% of its capacity. Among the nearly sixty big dams built in Morocco, only two are built in oasis regions: the El Mansour Eddahbi dam and the Hassan Eddakhil on the Ziz River. These two dams are the few exceptions in Morocco where water is given freely to the population for irrigation.',\n",
       "  '20': \"With the exception of the main canals, the traditional irrigation networks continue to operate. There have not been any changes to the plan of parcels and agricultural techniques.\\nthe indigenous populations make their way towards local, regional and national centres. The concentration of basic and socio-educative facilities in centres attracts rural populations. Thus, the percentage of the urban population in the Kingdom of Morocco has moved from 29.1% in 1960 to over 55. 1% in 2004. Despite the neglect of small centres in the statistics21 (M'hamid, Tagounite, Tamegroute, Tighoumar, Nkob, Tazarine etc.), we notice that the urban population has tripled in about 30 years. The policy of decentralization advocated by the state has led since 1976 to the reinforcement of the role of Communal districts. Zagora, a centre considered previously as part of Ouarzazate, became an independent province in 1997. The small localities previously counted as administrative centres themselves have experienced significant development. The creation of seats of Communes added to this system. Despite their still basic facilities, these centres attracted the rural population who are victims of natural conditions, and who strive to improve their standard of living. (See table 9) Tourism, which has for long been centred on coastal areas and imperial cities of the North, did not discover interior regions until the last decades. Today, with the desire to diversify tourism and with the emerging market of ecotourism, these areas have started to emerge as fully-fledged destinations. The cities of the south, Ouarzazate, Zagora and Erfoud start to present themselves as very dynamic tourist poles. Ouarzazate, with its different studios, is already considered as the capital of cinema.\\nThe Valley of Drâa today receives numerous flows of tourists, attracted by desert and oasis landscapes and the Ksar-type architecture. Although these crowds constitute an opportunity for the zone to diversify its economic resources, it poses a serious threat given their huge needs in terms of space, water, and the enormous waste they produce (hotels, camps, and bivouacs).\",\n",
       "  'METHODS': '',\n",
       "  'Justification of the selection': 'The choice of the two palm groves for a case study was dictated by the presence of two important elements of the subject of study, namely:\\nemigration and environmental degradation problems, in that they possess the following characteristics:\\n• Their out-of-the-way location far away from the centre of the country;\\n• Their arid, desert and continental climate;\\n• Scarcity and irregularity of water flows in the river feeding the palm groves; • Disruption of water flows due to the construction of a dam upstream;\\n• The high salinity of soils and of the water tables;\\n• Advancement of the desert and sand; • Their population pressure;\\n• Increasing needs both in quantity and quality and increasing pressure on resources (urbanization, tourism, modernisation); • Emigration traditions (nomads, merchants).',\n",
       "  'Discussion of methods': 'The standard EACH-FOR method is the starting point for this research. Limits of time and resources ruled out more extensive fieldwork. However, the standard approach was elaborated to make it possible to take some of the complexities of the relationship between environment and migration into account. However, the method was considered far from perfect by the research team to investigate all the complexities of the interrelationship between environment and migration thoroughly. In investigating this relationship we should take into account a time perspective, the various internal and external factors besides those of the environment that encourage migration, as well as processes of \\'cumulative causation\\' of migration once migration flows have started.\\nIdeally, the method should reflect the fact that migration phenomena in general and their relations to the environment in particular are extremely complex. There is no natural or human determinism in this domain. The role of factors that encourage, discourage, stimulate or aggravate these movements and their scale can vary from one place to another and from one community to another, depending on crises and changing circumstances. Scientific precaution requires the precise definition of central concepts, such as those of physical and human environment, of degradation, and the types of individual or collective responses to particular phenomena or needs. Answering the central questions with regard to the relation between environment and migration would ideally require not a one-time survey, but a continuous observation and repeated surveys as a basis for analysis of collective and individual behaviour and decision-making processes. It is clear that such a study would require much more time and resources than was available for this case study.\\nTo make it possible to take some of the complexities of the relationship between migration and environmental degradation processes into account, the standard EACH-FOR approach was supplemented with an extensive desk research on relevant contexts. To understand this relationship, the researchers have analysed what could be referred to as \"the factors encouraging migration\". This implies both the analysis of natural and of human conditions. The basis of the analysis of factors that encourage migration was laid by studying relevant literature, data and research reports. It implies the analysis of natural conditions, climate constraints, hydrogeological constraints such as irregular rainfall, scarcity and impoverishment of arable land, and the effects of the always onward creeping sands on living conditions in the palm groves. However, to understand the complex relationship between environmental constraints and migration, we have to analyse the human conditions as well: the social, economic, cultural and political contexts.\\nAll these contexts are presented in broad lines in the chapter 1 and they function as background knowledge for analysing the survey results in the chapter 3. For example, demographic characteristics and developments are of crucial importance for this analysis, in that population growth and the consequences of increasing pressure on resources create vulnerable conditions that could constitute a motive for people to migrate. Moreover, economic analysis of the production factors and their limitations and shortages is important when assessing the survival of populations and migration as a survival strategy. Furthermore, analysis of social transformations of the rural oasis society in contact with the outside world and the resulting erosion of traditional institutions is of utmost importance. Furthermore, political analysis is important. For example, the inter-tribe conflicts and the political context within which the decision was taken to build a dam on the Drâa River.\\nThe study of secondary sources constituted the basis for the fieldwork. For the fieldwork, the standard EACH-FOR approach and surveys was the departing point, while taking into consideration the numerous imperatives that surrounded the research. For example, while filling in the standard EACH-FOR questionnaires, stories about the lives of respondents were also written down and these were used to analyse the survey data and illustrate the analysis.\\nTo start the survey in the case study sites, the team had to decide on the criteria to select the respondents. The choice of individuals to be interviewed was done randomly in public spaces during the field trips. However, the team ensured that all relevant aspects were represented among the selected respondents. Within the villages or Ksour, quarters occupied by the Aribs, the Ait Atta, the Chorfas , and the Draouas were selected. For example, in order to clarify the question on the perception of environment, it is also important to take into account the socio-ethnic and socio-economic profiles of the interviewed persons.\\nFor the survey, only respondents in rural parts of the palm groves were selected that were considered to be affected by environmental problems and by migration. The migrant questionnaires involved 30 migrant household heads. Likewise the questionnaire for non-migrants involved 30 respondents or households. This means that every questionnaire involves in one way or another, a whole household, and within the same household several migrants could be found. When absent, the questions designed for migrants were sometimes posed to other members of the family. About 50% (14 cases) of migrant respondents were present at the time of the survey. For the rest (16 cases) we resorted to parents or to another relative to fill in the questionnaire. While this method brings relevant information regarding the migrating person, it could still miss certain information concerning the personal life of the migrant. But since we dealt with traditional families that are tightly knit and where the individual is only one element in a system and where all decisions are made within the family, we considered that the questionnaire was duly filled in. There is regular contact between migrants and those who stay behind. Migration is predominantly of a temporary or seasonal nature; permanent migration is very rare and less frequent.\\nThree types of informants were selected for interviews.\\n1. Interviews with 30 older migrants or the heads of households having emigrants in their families aimed at detecting the initial causes of emigration. Here the researcher, while having in mind the objective of investigating the correlation between migration and environmental developments, also considered related problems, such as unemployment, the loss of production, and the loss of the livestock. Relatively old respondents were selected because of the nature of the subject of research: the evolution of the environmental impact on migration.\\n2. Interviews with 30 non-migrants. These could also shed light on the obstacles, the resistance or the strategies each individual or group of individuals develop to be able to resist and not leave the territory.\\n3. Interviews with experts, namely agriculture technicians, administrative officers, Water and Forests technicians and researchers that have carried out studies in the area. These interviews enabled the case study researchers to open up to reflections on future developments of the territory.',\n",
       "  'FIELDWORK FINDINGS & ANALYSIS': '',\n",
       "  'General characteristics of migration in the region': 'According to interviewees, migration is an old tradition in the Drâa region in general and in particular in the selected sites. It is a phenomenon caused by several factors, among which the environmental factors related to the scarcity or lack of production factors prevail. However, the influence of the environment or the degradation of living conditions appears to be only slightly decisive in more recent migration flows. As will be demonstrated in this chapter, among migrants and non-migrants, the degradation of living conditions is frequently mentioned, but its role in the decision to migrate varies according to the circumstances and the period of the first migration in the life of each person.\\nThe reading of the surveys shows that 70% of the respondents mentioned the poor quality of the environment as a motive for their decision to migrate. For this category, environmental degradation and consequently economic and social deterioration left no choice. Their economic basis (agriculture or livestock) no longer ensured a minimum income to enable them to stay. Migration to \"improve\" their conditions and that of their families was considered the only option. For this category, the dates of departure are quite different.\\n-For the majority, the construction of the Dam in the early 1970s and the drought of the 1980s were fatal to their families. The consequences of blocking of the water flow by the barrier coincided with this harsh drought. This accelerated the degradation of the oasis ecosystems of the Drâa and notably those of the downstream ones of Ktaoua and M\\'hamid.\\n-There are however within this category those who were already migrants before these two events. These had migrated to remedy the scarcity of arable land or water. The emergence of these new factors (the dam in 1972 and the drought of the early 1980s) only strengthened the tradition of migration by opening the path to family reunification.\\n-For others, the environmental problems have only relatively recently been felt in their history.\\nIn the category directly affected by the poor quality of the environment, we can distinguish three social groups.\\na) Oasis farmers: that is, those who owned, before migration, land, water for irrigation and some cattle. These were small farmers, \"vulnerable\" to environmental problems, because their subsistence margins were very small.\\nb) The livestock farmers on the grazing or rangelands, whose economic activity was closely related to rainfall and climate conditions, implemented adaptation strategies based on the movement of the livestock and on the transfer of capital during the major crises. With the Moroccan-Algerian border conflicts, their lifestyle was complicated by the sudden forced sedentarisation. Consequently, they became more exposed to environmental constraints.\\nWithin this group there are two types of livestock herding practiced mainly by two different ethnic communities:\\n• The Ait-Atta, are Berber nomads who roam desert territory mainly with herds of sheep and goats and some camels. These nomads have rights over arable land of their mother-tribe or their protégés (the Draouis). This means that they had the opportunity to reconvert into farmers whenever necessary. This conversion -massive and suddenly \\'forced\\' by the consequences of dam construction and drought -has increased the pressure on natural resources and thus stimulated further environmental degradation. The massive sedentarisation of nomads and their conversion into farmers has had a direct impact on the decision to migrate of members of this group. Their installation resulted in the extensions of the oasis by water pumping that led to a lowering of the water table.\\n• The community of the Aaribs, Sahrawi nomadic Arabs originating from the Western Sahara, worked primarily as camel and goat breeders.\\nTheir pastoral area stretched several zones along the Algeria-Morocco border. With the border conflict and the recurrent droughts, the pastures grew poorer and inaccessible and these people without rights to arable land found themselves forced to settle in quarters of the rural centre of M\\'hamid. This nomadic ethnic group is the poorest in the region, but their social and cultural membership to the tribes of the Western Sahara gave them a special tradition of migration.\\nc) The Draouis, a black community without land or pastures, had the tradition of working on the land of others (Ahrar (= the free) landowners). The status of agricultural workers of this category made their tradition of migration particularly different. It is in this group that one observes a deeprooted, prolonged or even permanent migration in several cases.\\nThe migration destinations are closely linked to this ethnic diversity. This means that in most cases, the destinations of migration are mapped out because of their membership of a particular group. The migration occurs by making use of socio-ethnic or family networks.\\nFor the Aaribs, the cities throughout the territory of the Western Sahara are the main destination. The choice of this destination is dictated first and foremost by the family and cultural ties to the Sahara and its people. The cultural dimension is a key facilitator in their settlement and integration. This advantage is supplemented by the attraction of high wages in comparison to other regions of Morocco. The opportunities offered by this region of the country are great (high urbanisation, maritime and mining activities). The Aribs start with any profession and eventually end up by switching to comfortable and lucrative activities such as trade and public administration.\\nThe majority of the Draouis are attracted to the cities of Casablanca and Rabat. Because of their long history of settlement (native population), the Draouis have established family ties (endogamous marriages) and community relations dictated by the constraints of oasis environments. This situation has undoubtedly encouraged their concentration in agricultural occupations and in the building sector, but also their ability to switch to other professions. The Draouis have a high level of solidarity to one another (See fore example: Zainab, thesis in progress).\\nFor the Ait Atta their range of destinations is linked to family networks (Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakech, Agadir, and Tangier). Shepherds at first and then warriors throughout their turbulent history, they currently work in these cities in commerce and on large construction sites. Thus, the socio-ethnic structure, as demonstrated by the survey, also explains the variety of jobs performed by migrants.\\nThe analysis of the relationships between migrants and their villages of origin shows that the commitment varies from one community to another. As an example, when the land of one community could no longer support the increasing needs of its inhabitants, none of the respondents had sold his land after departure. For them, land constitutes their \\'roots\\'. However, one can perceive the beginning of a trend of permanent emigration and the selling of land property.\\nAccess to basic services such as electricity, schools, and health care explains partially the migration phenomena, even though the availability of such services today does not affect the decision to stay in the village.\\nAccess to financial services does not have any weight. In this context, exchange is done by barter (to trade by exchanging goods or services without using money). Loans are not well considered and are perceived as a Jewish practice from the past. Accordingly, using bank services remains limited.\\nSimilarly, belonging to a (formal) organization does not have an important place in the society. Belonging to the community is what still counts for most persons and successful associations in the region are modelled on an ethnic or village basis.\\nThe consequences of this migration are varied. The remittances of migrants injected in the zone are of huge importance since they guarantee the immobility and maintenance (survival) of the other family members in the village (bled). They also permit the creation of other businesses (commerce, transportation, tourism) or the continuation of agricultural activity, and dynamism in the construction sector.',\n",
       "  'Socio-demographic characteristics of migrants': \"The general socio-demographic characteristics of the 30 interviewed migrants are quasi similar: men, married, intermarried, same religion, aged between 48 and 58, and illiterate. A detailed analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of the migrants could have explained many facets of the relation between the migrants and his/her environment. However, due to limits of time for this case study we limit ourselves to presenting the general characteristics only. These are: • Relatively aged migrants segment. As indicated and justified in chapter 2, the selected migrant respondents were quite old. More than 60% are aged 50 years or over and about 40% are aged less than 50 years. Yet, once we look at the date of migration, it becomes clear that they were only 20 or 30 when they first left the village. The migrant population has aged far from its home village.\\n• Exclusively male migrants. In a traditional and conservative society, the women who do not join their migrant husband will not leave their village.\\nThe study showed that only males participate in the migration movement. Women stay in their village and play a key role in oasis life.\\nThey assure continuity and the transmission of the cultural heritage. Leaving one's village and family to work elsewhere used to be an impossible thing to do for a woman, for it endangers the dignity of the entire family and in particular, that of her husband and her siblings. Today, schooling and migration helped to alter the situation slightly. Unmarried women or widows may leave to work in the city, or even in Europe within the framework of bilateral agreements (agricultural work in Spain). It is the start of a new cultural era in the zone.\\n• Mostly illiterate migrants. The high rate of illiterates among the migrants is a very telling indicator of the insecure conditions that prevail in oasis life. It is also an indicator that elucidates the difficulties they face in taking part in regular life. In fact, 63% answered that they have never received any education. About 25% declared that they received primary education, while 12% went to traditional religious schools.\\n• Married people taking care of parents and children. Taking into consideration the age of the respondents, it is normal that all the interviewed people are married. However, it is worth mentioning that early marriage in the society is a tradition. The woman takes part in every agricultural and domestic activity and the children constitute an added value to the family work force. They constitute an important capital to cope with the different hazards and an insurance for the parents as they grow old. Thus, 63% of the emigrants take care of their parents and 50% declared that they have five children to care for. 38% of the respondents have 4 children to take care for and 12 respondents have 6 persons or more to care for. In a society known for the solidarity of its members, it is not exceptional to find brothers, sisters and sometimes even nephews supported by one single person.\",\n",
       "  'The non-migrants or potential migrants': '',\n",
       "  'Characteristics of the non-migrants': \"The perception of the environment by the non-migrants does not differ from that of the migrants. The respondent's answers to the questions show their growing awareness of the degradation of essential elements of the environment. The non-migrants say that this degradation of the environment and the resulting decline of economy pressed the men to look for adequate solutions in Moroccan cities or abroad.\\nSo why did they not leave? All the problems that the emigrants encountered are raised while talking with those that stayed behind: problems with the environment, no access to financial resources, not belonging to organisations that might help to find solutions and the overburdened family. However, each interviewee had one or more reasons not to leave. These can be listed as follows:\\n• The non-migrant lives from the remittances of a brother or an emigrant parent. • S/he has an activity that generates sufficient revenues to stay in the region. • S/he has old parents whom s/he cannot leave behind (no pension) ; • The children are still young and there is no one to care for their needs ;\\n• He waits for his turn in a tradition of role-taking between males in the family; • S/he is handicapped and makes a living through a local activity; • S/he does not leave the region except to go to a foreign country. The revenues of working in a city are not an incentive to leave the home village.\\nWith all this in mind, we note that the majority of these non -migrants have migration plans and they intend to migrate as soon as the conditions are positive. Besides the reasons shared by all, the personal profile of the respondent plays a role in the decision-making process. The main characteristics of the interviewed non-migrants are:\\n• Relatively young population. The average age of the category is about 42 years. More than half are younger than 45 and about 30% are less than 30 years. Yet in this category we also found men of more than 55 years.\\n• An increasingly educated population. Because the Drâa valley was isolated and under-equipped in the past, the majority of the migrants are illiterate. The category of the non-migrants is in majority literate or has at least attended school. Only 25% are illiterate compared to 75% of respondents who are relatively educated. More than 30% have been to secondary school. This can be explained by the young age of this category and because of the construction of schools in the region since the 1960s and the general spreading of schooling over the last decades.\\n• A relatively high rate of single people. This category of population demonstrates characteristics different from the migrants' as far as married life is concerned. More than 50% of respondents are single 22 . Those who are married show socio-economic and familial characteristics of families with a migration tradition. 25% of the interviewed population are migrants who came back to the region because of their age (between 55 and 62), or after having guaranteed a job position for their children or having secured an activity back home that provides them a good income. Thus, if the majority of respondents declare that they are single, it is not because of a difference in culture due to schooling. In a Muslim country like Morocco, the general opinion is that anyone who has reached the legal age to be eligible to marry should do so, depending of course on the availability of resources. These means are precisely lacking in many cases.\",\n",
       "  'What does the home village offer to keep them from leaving?': \"The perception of the environment of non-migrants does not differ from that of the migrants. On the base of an analysis of the different responses, four explanations become evident for the decision of persons to remain in the home village (bled) can be discerned:\\na. The respondent has a physical or social constraint:\\nAging parents whom you cannot leave behind due to cultural and religious reasons My wife and I live on the help provided by our kids who are settled in Casablanca. Since we cannot go abroad at our age, we care for the small family which remains here.\\nOr the case of a handicapped person who did well to manage a business and who gets money from migrants via an intermediary who stayed in the village.\\nb. Practicing seasonal migration as a temporary solution:\\nI left and came back after installing a son in the place of migration. Then I returned to care for the remaining members of the family and retired.\\nNo matter what, we cannot all go. There should be a man at home to look after the house and its remaining inhabitants. I am now in the process of setting up a hotel with my migrant brothers in Casablanca to boost the family income and eventually to improve the situation of our family.\\nI am 24 and I have already left the village several times. When I noticed that our land is not that productive, I had to do 22 It is noticeable that the average age of marriage is increasing. The long phase of celibacy is more remarkable in the case of men than in that of women. This should be linked to schooling, joblessness and the crumbling of the extended family. something to help my parents. I left school because of these problems with our agriculture. It is agriculture that allowed my parents to raise us and assure all our needs. But when I work elsewhere, the salaries are so low. I was getting 40 MDH (Moroccon Dirhams) per day to pay the rent, food and other needs. By the end of the month, I had nothing to send to my parents. That is why I decided to go back. Here I would not pay the rent, eat and at night I could give something to my parents. c. Manage a non-agricultural enterprise. Those who stay in the home village are commonly those who utilise the money of those who migrated to invest in service activities. For example, a grocery store, a means of transportation like a taxi, a tourist hotel that generates money and even foreign currency.\\nd. Waiting for an opportunity to migrate far away. Most non-migrants, have aspiration to go abroad.\\nIf I have to leave this zone, it is to go to Europe or America and why not Australia. Now, I manage a shop (multipurpose commerce), it is only to amass money and once I find a way out through a visa, a work permit or even a wedding I will definitely leave. However, I would never accept being a clandestine migrant.\\nLike everybody else, life conditions were not favourable. I had to leave my town many times at an early age to work in many cities. I tried many jobs but the wages were too low and everything I earned only covered my expenses but I could not save anything or send anything to my parents. I go back home for some months when my father's land is relatively productive. But when things go bad I restart my migration, without success. Finally, I decided to remain in my village and build my life here or to go far away… Today and due the opening of the oasis, staying in the village does not mean forgetting about leaving, it rather pushes to think about it. The 'success' exposed by emigrants during their visits home is largely sufficient to incite everybody to hope to leave and be part of that group; thus, a culture of migration has spread in the villages\",\n",
       "  'Analysis of the results and perceptions of the environment': '',\n",
       "  'Perception of the environment by the respondents': 'The first question asked of all the respondents -migrants and non-migrantsaimed at finding out what they knew about environment in general and their local environment in particular. For the non-migrants -relatively educated persons -the concept is clear, while further clarifications were required for interviews with migrants. The environment and its changes are viewed as a constraint with which they have to comply and adapt to, because it is a resource, and even more because it is viewed as a revelation of divine will against which humans have no power.\\nFor the population of the Drâa valley the degradation of the environment affects the agricultural production negatively. The scarcity of water, the salinisation of water and land, sand coverage, the bayoud disease and the degradation of grazing spaces constitute handicapping elements. These factors, even if they have always existed, have increased in frequency, duration and amplitude in recent decades.\\nWhen we enlarge the scope of the environment to include the economic, political, cultural and social dimensions, responses were provided with much more certainty. It was clear to the respondents that the region is marginalized, under-equipped and suffers from local conflicts. Access to arable land, water and grazing land being determined by the social status, is highly relevant for migration decisions, at least for the predecessors.\\nFor the sedentary peasants, the oasis could produce three agricultural crops per year. Today one cannot cultivate anything. Some remarks:\\nMy memories go back more than 25 years, I was 10 and we suffered at the time from summer heat, dust storms and water scarcity, but our palm groves were productive... The crop of dates was abundant, the livestock from each family was \"big\". But since 1984 we witnessed a decline of vital elements … According to the worsening degradation, people leave to look for additional revenue in the hope of going back to take up their normal life.\\n30 years ago, the palm grove of M\\'hamid was relatively prosperous … it is true that there had always been dust in the form of ergs (erg = a vast desert area of deep, rolling sand dunes), sand storms, droughts, but we were producing our basic necessities. Today we hardly cultivate anything on the land, fruit-bearing trees disappeared and palm trees do not produce regular and sufficient crops as they used to. Knowing that the mouths to feed are numerous, only one solution can be thought of by the people-finding alternative revenues at the construction sites of the big cities.\\nFor the nomads, the degradation of the environment manifests itself in the decrease of grazing land, the meagre vegetation coverage and hence the decline of their activity. Confronted with such an environmental and economic crisis situation, the people chose to migrate.\\nWhen the conditions were good, the group of Aaribs were nomads. It was the best lifestyle: no frontiers and many horizons. Rain does not fall as it used to. The pastures are scanty and the movement of shepherds is decreasing with shrinking horizons.\\nThis leads to increasing pressure on the pastures and to worsening conditions. Consequently, we are obliged to settle. Confronted with this situation, looking for other alternatives elsewhere is a solution.',\n",
       "  'Environment and the migration decision': 'In response to the question on the relation between environmental conditions and the decision to migrate (see Annex, Table 10 on Factors impacting on migration decisions), 28 out of 30 respondents confirmed that degradation of the environment is one of the major causes that motivated them to take the decision to migrate. 2 respondents said that environmental degradation did not pose a problem for them; the migration decision was dictated by other motivations.\\nAbout 20 respondents said they left their residence of origin because of environmental problems. 6 cases confirmed that environmental problems did not emerge until later in the course of their migration itinerary. This means that migration was dictated by other factors or motivations. A conflict in the family, an adventurous spirit, or else the quest for independence from the extended family could explain this tendency. For this category, while the migration adventure started provisional, the environmental constraints intervened to prolong it.\\nFour respondents declared that environmental problems are recent. This makes us think that this category is not affected by these problems. However, when we analyse their stories -old tenant farmers who worked for big families all the year for 1/5 of the harvest plus nourishment -we find out that it is only a question of shifting the problem.\\nDegradation affects only families exercising agricultural activities.\\nAs far as we are concerned, we left because we had nothing to lose. We worked for others here and we will do the same thing somewhere else, it is all the same.\\nWhen we bring up the diversity of dimensions of the environmental issue, other parameters emerge and the responses vary. The oases of Ktaoua and M\\'hamid have a unique situation as a geographically marginalized and underequipped local. This reality is also reflected in the answers. Concerning socioeducational facilities (education, health, leisure), their absence is an important factor for migration in about 20 of the cases. Thus, despite the effort made by the state, a huge delay is still recorded in this area of basic services. The attitude of the population towards the school, at least in the beginning, was negative and children did not go to school because they had to work in the fields or as shepherds. The first collège (the second stage of the primary education) did not open its doors in Zagora (around 100 km from M\\'hamid) until the beginning of the 1960s, while a general secondary school (lycée) was located in Ouarzazate or even in Marrakech. Today, the majority of rural communes have a collège.\\nSimilarly, the absence of health services is seen as a major concern (big hospitals are restricted even today to capitals of provinces). This fact is increasingly affecting migration decisions. Existing facilities are distant (Zagora, Ouarzazate, or even Marrakech) and transportation means are either scarce or inaccessible.\\nConcerning the responses related to political problems and conflicts (See Annex, Table 10), the respondents, with the exception of two, answered that these factors played no important role in their migration decisions. Undoubtedly, these declarations conceal all the frictions due to the border conflict that turned into a lasting reality over time. The conflict was at the origin of the settling process of many camel herding nomads.\\nThe problems related to the economic environment illustrate the problems with the natural environment. The inadequacy of revenues and its relation to migration decision were raised in 26 cases. Unemployment, an outcome of the factors mentioned above, is also raised by many people.\\nAll the respondents declared that the construction of the El Mansour Eddahbi dam upstream of the oasis is an important factor that led to the degradation of production conditions (See Annex, Table 11). For them, stopping the natural flow of Drâa River has had particularly negative effects on oasis life. Water tables dried up and intensive evaporation increased the salinity of water and soils. The rise of salinity has rendered soils infertile. The decline of yields and their irregularity is considered decisive in over 21 cases.\\nThe drought of the 1980s is considered by nearly half the interviewees as a huge natural disaster. It affected all the socio-economic classes and all types of agricultural activities, including pastoral activity. In a society where agriculture and cattle breeding constitute the backbone of economy, environmental change had a major impact on the livelihood of the population.\\nThus, even if the concept of \\'environment\\' is not explicitly apparent in the discourse, conducting a more in-depth analysis, as summarized above, shows that it is strongly present in people\\'s life and influences their socioeconomic and demographic behaviours. Problems posed by pests and diseases are also widely raised by all, in particular the date palm disease and locust invasions.\\nThe survey shows that the availability of fertilizers, seeds and the costs of water are among the least relevant factors, given the free availability of water (\"a divine good\") and the self-production of organic fertilizers and seeds. The strategy of farmers is predominantly based on the diversity of resources, mixed farming and multiple cropping and utilizing the large size of households to resort to workers from the family. Transhumance and livestock mobility are also a form of adaptation to fragility and hazards.\\nThe reactions of the respondents to this decline vary according to the main activity they performed. While nomads start by selling off their cattle to purchase fodder and to maintain their activity, cultivators refuse to sell their land or their water rights. Men show a strong attachment to their land. On the other hand they mostly have livestock that constitutes savings that can be used in hard times (See Annex, Table 12). Nomads, especially those without land property, have only the option of selling part of their herd depending on the circumstances. Many times, they end up selling their entire herd and settle down for good. The case of the Aarib group is very indicative in this regard.\\nBefore the present situation, our family used to own over forty camels, some goats and sheep. Since the beginning of the eighties, drought took worrying dimensions, and we had no choice but to sell our livestock to be able to survive and provide for the rest of the herd. Everything happened very quickly and our activity crumbled. Thus we became poor overnight…\\nThe logical reaction was for the majority to migrate in quest of revenues that would allow the rest of the family to stay in the village \"waiting to see things return to how they used to be\", says one respondent.',\n",
       "  'Access to services and the migration decision': 'The small rural centres that serve the two palm groves have some basic services (administration, school, basic health care room, weekly market; see Annex, Table 13), while they used to lack nearly all elements of comfort during the colonial era. The wide distribution of gas, electricity, telephone and drinking water did not start until the end of the last century. In the rural areas, the last decade experienced a number of improvements to services. 23 However, it is worth noting that the presence of services does not necessarily indicate that the population has access to them. Furthermore, these services do not bind populations to their home region. In contrast, modern facilities and equipment (electricity, telephone 24 , etc.) encourage consumption and thus departure.\\nFinancially, the capital of the farmer and his treasury are constituted by his buildings, land property and livestock. Credits for farmers have not yet been introduced in this society (See Annex, Table 14). The resort to credit is even considered to be a social and religious offence. In case of real need, the option of mortgage or family support constitutes the main solution. However, today, these practices are acceptable especially in case of bank loans. The presence of government employees, tourists and emigrants made this service a necessity, while in the past it was exclusively urban. In the non-migrants category, many persons have resorted to loans to fund their projects.',\n",

       "  '23': 'The Moroccan government has launched many programs to reduce poverty among the rural population and to discourage rural exodus, including: PAGER (program of supplying rural populations with potable water), the PERG (program of global rural electrification), the PNRR (national program of rural roads), and the operation to of safeguard livestock. Interviews with experts living in the Drâa basin areas or who worked on the issue enables us to have a more objective view on the assumed relation between migration and the environment. We have tried to diversify the profiles of these experts. These interviews were with technical agricultural specialists, elected representative of the Commune, civil society representatives (NGOs) and researchers. A selection of their arguments is recorded here in order to give life to the story.',\n",
       "  'The state of the environment: are oases in agony?': 'The tone is a bit exaggerated, but worrying. Certainly, ecosystems are fragile and highly vulnerable. The crisis situation is linked to many factors. Poor management of water resources coupled with shortage of water and worsened by an uncontrolled waste (motor pumping). The breakdowns of traditional community institutions, the crumbling of lands, the complexity of land rights, and overpopulation together suffocate agriculture, considered as the foundation of the rural economy. Over time, the population managed to create a balance between the frailty of natural resources and the satisfaction of its needs. With the arrival of modern administration, the State took charge of the management of space through different departments (Ministry of Agriculture and the Office of Agricultural Development (ORMVA, l\\'Office de la Mise en Valeur Agricole), the High Officer of Waters and Forests, the Territorial administration)\". This crumbling resulted in the tremendous malfunctioning and consequently in often disastrous environmental consequences.\\nHydro-agricultural development carried out in the Drâa Valley is considered among the most important large hydraulic operations undertaken on the fringes of the desert of the Maghreb. The project aimed at regulating floods, protecting agricultural lands and equipment. Regarding the perverse effects, as they are inherent to any intervention, we should just find out how to manage them and render them positive.\" Thus, \"if the installation of the hydraulic equipment has had as a corollary the emergence of urban centres, the development of extraagricultural activities, the development of tourism, and consequently of new water consumers, new disruptions, the improvement of landscapes and of local culture could constitute ways to a more integrated development.\\nWe should hence not give up and let down the civilization of our ancestors. Research and experiments on the possibilities of improving, initiating and innovating in these spaces should be reinforced.',\n",
       "  'Coping with the environmental crisis?': 'Drâa oases in general and those in difficulty such as Ktaoua and M\\'hamid in particular gave birth to reactions full of pessimism. These reactions disregard the efforts made by the State through the different bodies in charge of the development and the management of public affairs in this zone\". \"…the construction of a dam on the Drâa River determines life in oases and the creation of a regional Office of Agricultural Development (ORMVA) as a technical organ charged with the resolution of a number of problems in the Drâa Valley. Water management, the fight against desertification, the training of farmers, the introduction of new animal and vegetable species, the fight against diseases such as the bayoud in different forms (scientific research, in vitro culture of tissues resistant to the disease and the distribution of over a hundred of thousands of cultivars among farmers to save palms groves) and the organization of farmers are some of the actions aimed at promoting development in the largest meaning of the term.\\nThe dam and the Office are in my opinion the fire-fighters that came in at a time when the valley was in need of assistance. Obviously, many things are still to be done and many others need to be reviewed in view of the new foundations and conceptions, but without the dam and the Office and other administrations, the situation in the valley would have been far more serious than today. The population considers the dam to be the only problem that is facing their oasis and the agents working with the dam as thieves of water due to their attachment to the past prosperity of their agriculture and to the abundance of water, but the circumstances have changed and they are just incapable of appreciating our efforts. Like all the other hydroagricultural structures, that of the valley has undesirable consequences, but it saves it from an ecological and human disaster (an engineer).\\nWe know that the administration and accompanying structures are inadequate. For this reason, research programs and projects are being implemented in partnership with various national and international organisations in order to remedy the observed defects. But we have to look also for new possibilities. At this level, civil society and the population itself have to be mobilized to create ownership of what others implement (public officer).',\n",
       "  \"Agriculture's bankruptcy?\": 'Climate change, the scarcity of water, soil degradation and the overpopulation of oases will certainly be factors that push people to migrate. Only a liar could tell you that we could restore the previous situation and prevent men from migrating. We strive to maintain a minimal balance to ensure the survival of palm groves in order to develop other sectors. Tourism and film industry activities, attracted by the oasis landscapes already offer employment opportunities to people from outside the valley. There are thus people that leave and people that arrive. The equation is not totally negative!\" (civil society executive).\\nWherever you go, even in most developed countries, there is migration. We should only accompany people in order to readapt to new realities: declaring the end of the agricultural era and announcing that of tourism and cinema (elected representative).\\nThis way of considering space is in our opinion very questionable, because we can reverse the question and say: will there be oases in the absence of water and agriculture? Will tourists and cinema people have the capacity and the know-how required to manage the fragility that the population of oases has been addressing for millennia? And what attraction would the oases have without their original inhabitants? (senior expert official).',\n",
       "  'Marginality and hope': \"Given the accumulated delays so far and the expectations stimulated by the opening of the oasis, development is not at all easy to achieve. The communes of M'hamid and Ktaoua are the last to receive help, including by nature.\\nWe are in a zone where all natural ingredients are bad. Water arrives scarcely to the palm groves. Precipitation is among the lowest of the valley, temperature is the highest, and the evaporation rate is the highest of the valley. In addition to the bayoud and to locust invasions, the quality of underground water is worst and sand advances significantly.\\nAt the level of the state's intervention and development efforts, taking into account the outlying situation of these palm groves, their efforts are the weakest in this zone: this is a zone situated in a deadlock, under-equipped, remote, and suffering worrying delays in socio-educational fields and the highest scores in terms of unemployment and exclusion (civil society executive).\\nHowever, a lot of things have changed in recent years. The arrival of paved roads and the arrival of travel agencies enabled these communes to open up towards and to be related to other regions of Morocco and to the transportation of basic provisions. Electricity plays a significant role in the population's life. The supply of drinking water to the centres of M'hamid and Tagounit by the National Office of Potable Water (ONEP) is important for the population. The programs of supplying dispersed villages with potable water by the Associations (AEP) or by public fountains are well advanced. This equipment enables the development of different activities, mainly tourism and tertiary activities. The existence of basic administration saves people from the trouble of travelling long distances to obtain a simple administrative document. Community clinics, even if installed only in centres, ensure that the population benefits from basic treatments. School infrastructures enable all children to benefit from primary and secondary schooling. School drop out, especially for girls, still constitutes a serious problem in rural regions. The efforts made by civil society 25  are very praiseworthy, provided that they are timely (elected representative).\\nAlthough environmental or natural problems go beyond the means put at the disposal of local competencies, they try to fight against these problems in collaboration with different partners. The fight against the advancement of the desert constitutes a daily concern and the efforts made are important 26 . The rehabilitation of the date palm heritage, although still in its early stages, has started to yield encouraging results. With the big festival of nomads at M'hamid, the ambition is to make these zones attractive tourist destinations capable of ensuring employment for the young people in order to introduce new dynamics.\",\n",
       "  'CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH': \"To conclude, we can say that the study was an opportunity to test a number of paradigms en situ, the most central one being the relation between environment and migration. Research focussing on this subject can be considered innovative, but one should be aware of the risk of falling into ineffective determinism. There is no natural determinism in this field, and thus it is as appropriate to ask the reverse question: Why do populations resist and persist even if environmental conditions, already structurally severe, are deteriorating. To investigate the main questions, we opted to launch our study in one of the harshest areas in Morocco: the most peripheral oases most exposed to environmental risks. Starting with the analysis of a diverse and abundant literature, recent field work and the results of the survey, we can sum up our observations as follows:\\n• Migration is a normal adaptation strategy of poor people, responding to human needs. It may even be a necessary response to reduce pressure of populations on natural resources, by diversifying revenues.\\nAuthorities should be worried only if migration occurs suddenly and massively. Migration cannot be curbed, but only regulated.\\n• If the harshness of living conditions encourages people to leave, it is not all-determining. Otherwise, how could we explain the presence of populations in equally harsh zones such as deserts (Sahara, Arctic, etc.), and how could we explain the strong attachment of populations to these territories?\\n• The impact of environmental constraints is very relative. Over time, people adapt and create mechanisms and relevant strategies to adapt to these constraints and to transcend them. It is more appropriate to consider environmental constraints and degradation as weakening elements within a local society capable of triggering outmigration and other transformations at any moment, especially when they aggravate suddenly and brutally (droughts, dam building).\\n• Factors with regard to socio-cultural, economic and political settings are important for migration decisions. Factors that weakened traditional society and its adaptation to the oasis environment brought about by colonization, contact with cities, international migration, education, media, the interventions of the state are more pertinent than changes in the natural environment. In fact, the effects of the dam, of border conflicts and of tourism are mentioned much more as trigger factors than droughts and climate changes.\\n• Interviews with rural inhabitants and migrants show that according to them the negative impact of environmental degradation on agriculture and livestock farming over the last decades is a main motive for migration. The population considers the dam and the administrations in charge of it as the cause of the crisis. On the other hand, technicians think that populations' failure to keep pace with changes hinders development. The expert interviews indicate that the relation between environment and migration is much more complex and less deterministic.\\n• The opening of the oasis brought about by education, the media, migration, and tourism have caused a brutal confrontation between urban and rural life styles, those of developed and of underdeveloped countries. This comparison uncovers inequalities, creates aspirations and lessons, and releases the spirit of adventure that characterises migration. The improvement of one's social status and the standard of living of one's family has become a leitmotiv for the youth.\\n• The mechanisms of migration vary between the different occupational and socio-ethnic groups. Migration produces its own dynamics.\\nAlthough internal migration of family members is still dominant, permanent migration of families is occurring more often.\\n• There are relevant differences between migrants and non-migrants, but not in their perception of environmental degradation. Almost all families are affected by temporary or seasonal migration; family members leave for others to stay. Those who stay behind often have to wait their turn, or because of social norms (women, care for children or parents) or because of other ways to earn a living (commercial activities). Even in harsh climate conditions people develop mechanisms and strategies of adaptation.\\nD5. Sudden natural disaster like flood, earthquake, storms, insects \"},\n",
       " 12: {'abstract': 'The Hawaweer, a nomadic, pastoralist group in northern Sudan, were seriously affected by the drought in the Sahel during the mid-1980s. Their experience illustrates the connection between internally displaced people, normal mobility, forced migration, dilemmas and opportunities of return and how new livelihoods can be successfully constructed based on traditional rights, strong local institutions and external resources. Some displaced Hawaweer got the chance to return to their homeland as new livelihood opportunities were established; others did not get this opportunity nor would they have returned if they had been given the chance. In both situations, the processes of displacement and return had an impact on the sense of belonging and identity.',\n",
       "  'Forced migration and homecoming': \"Many people around the world are forced to migrate, to settle in places where they are not welcome, to construct new livelihoods and to change their ways of living. This study focuses on internally displaced nomadic pastoralists, the Hawaweer of Wadi Al Muggadam in the northern part of Sudan, who were forced to migrate in the mid-1980s due to the serious Sahel drought and famine. The famine experienced by the Hawaweer was triggered by the failure of rainfall which resulted in both rich and poor people losing all their livestock, being forced to migrate and becoming what they perceived as 'servants' in communities where they were not welcome by the local people (mainly the Nile region in northern Sudan). Although the triggering factor of the famine was rainfall failure and the Hawaweer became categorised as environmental refugees, it should be noted that famines are usually politically related, no matter how diverse the triggering factors might be (Devereux, 2000). The purpose of this study is to investigate forced migration, processes of return and how successful livelihood construction in the homelands of the returned forced migrants can be facilitated. Many studies have examined forced migrants returning to their homelands or being resettled in new locations. The terms used to describe such processes of return are recovery, reconstruction, repatriation and rehabilitation. But, as Hammond (1999) stresses, these concepts might as well be perceived as construction, creativity, innovation and improvisation. The return process is not about going home or back in time to regain something that once existed, it creates an entirely new situation. The processes of change experienced by the Hawaweer illustrate this when they returned to their homeland and constructed new livelihoods based on traditional rights and new opportunities. In marginal lands and economically poor areas such as the drylands of northern Sudan, return and homecoming are indeed intertwined with livelihood security opportunities -and with survival.\\nThe study addresses the following research questions:\\n• How do internally displaced people cope with situations of forced migration, and how do nomadic people perceive normal mobility and forced movement? • To what degree, and why, do some displaced people choose to return to their homelands while others choose to stay where they settle down; and how do these different choices affect belonging and identity? • How can successful processes be facilitated for the return of forced migrants to their homelands whereby new opportunities are created and sustainable livelihoods encouraged?\\nIt is important to underline that the successful return of people once forced to migrate should not be seen as an argument advocating that return is always the best solution. This research is not based on such an underlying assumption that return is always the best option for forced migrants. For forced migrants the possibility or right to stay in the area where they settle down might be as important as the right to return to one's homeland. Internationally, the right to return appears to be more recognised than the right to stay. The important challenge is how to make both these rights operational.\\nThe focus of this study, however, is how to operationalise internally displaced people's right to return by creating new opportunities to construct sustainable livelihoods where traditional survival strategies have failed.\",\n",
       "  'The nomadic pastoralist group Hawaweer': 'The nomadic pastoralist ethnic group, Hawaweer, who live in the drylands of northern Sudan, were selected for this particular study on forced migration, processes of return and livelihood reconstruction for the following reasons. The Hawaweer were seriously affected by the drought and human disaster in the Sahelian countries during the mid-1980s; the majority of the Hawaweer based in Wadi Al Muggadam were forced to migrate in order to survive; and, in addition, rather successful return processes have taken place during the 1990s. One purpose of this research is to investigate the lessons learned from these relatively successful processes of return and reconstruction of livelihood. Another purpose is to document what happened to a group of people badly hit by the drought and human disaster in Sahel in the mid-1980s. Another criterion for the selection was that 10 years of institutional collaboration between ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency), NORAD (Norwegian Development Cooperation Agency) and Noragric/NLH (Agricultural University of Norway) provided the firsthand knowledge, personal contacts and networks essential for undertaking the study. This institutional collaboration also provided access to secondary unpublished sources of information such as project reports, technical reports, reviews and evaluations.',\n",
       "  'Research approach': \"In examining primary sources of information, qualitative research methods were applied, multi-faceted in time, sources and geographic sites, and which included different tools and approaches such as individual and group interviews, key informant interviews, participatory observations and natural resource mapping. Fieldwork was undertaken twice in the period 1998-2000 in the Khartoum/Omdurman area, Nile region, Wadi Al Muggadam and Um Jawasir. The key informants interviewed were local men and women leaders, civil servants, NGO/ADRA project staff, university faculty and refugee camp employees. The participatory observations comprised visits to refugee camps around Khartoum/Omdurman, visits to displaced Hawaweer along the Nile river in the north (Korti, Merowe, Karima, Al Gorer), visits to the Hawaweer at different geographical sites within their traditional homeland in Wadi Al Muggadam (such as Wadi El Braiga and Rigriga), walking around the farms in the irrigated area in Um Jawasir, visits to rain-fed agriculture sites in Wadi Gumur and visits to old and new Tamtam (bus station and service centre).\\nInterviews with Hawaweer men and women include focus group interviews, interviews with elderly people, individual interviews of Hawaweer with irrigated land in the ADRA/NORAD-funded project, as well as people without land, interviews and field visits with local leaders, meetings and interviews with local institutions (popular committee, farmers committee, women's committee, local government, teachers) and an interview with a representative of the private sector (Sherian). Natural resource mapping with local leaders was undertaken to obtain an overview of grassland, rain-fed agriculture and wildlife resources. The interviews were open-ended without any use of questionnaires or interview guides. The informants were selected by applying the snowball principle and based on time availability and their willingness to share experiences with us. Contacts were established while walking around, riding donkeys or participating in ceremonies (baptisms, weddings), social events (parties, plays, dinner parties), the women's group and women's market and by visiting schools, local shops and cafés. The aim was to create informal and casual settings for interaction and discussion and to avoid formal interview settings. However, if approached by someone who did wish to make a more formal appointment, we accepted. In this process, we made sure that those interviewed represented different groups of people such as returnees, people who remained during the drought and displaced Hawaweer. These included men and women, old and young; agro-pastoralists living within and outside the project; the poor and the better off; people 'living' inside the Um Jawasir project area and people living 'outside' this area.\\nIn addition to the qualitative interviews and observations, a questionnaire was planned and funded by the research team and conducted (including data analysis) by a local researcher, Khalid S. Moh. The questionnaire asked people to give their reasons to return or not to return to Um Jawasir. A sample of 45 respondents was randomly selected using the population census of 1994 as a frame (1,106 households). When results from this survey are supplied in the article, reference is given to Moh (1999).\",\n",
       "  'The Hawaweer, drought and hunger': \"The Hawaweer inhabit four states in northern Sudan but the majority live in Northern State. They account for about 20 per cent of the population there, numbering about 300,000 (Moh, 1999) and are the third-largest ethnic group after the Hasania and the Kababish. The most influential ethnic group in the state is the Shaigia, who live around the Nile River near the Egyptian border. The Hawaweer are nomadic pastoralists and their traditional homeland in Northern State is Wadi Al Muggadam in the middle of the Bayoda desert, a dry tributary of the Nile, which starts in Kordofan in western Sudan and joins the Nile in Korti in northern Sudan (10-20km wide and 130km long). Um Jawasir is situated in the middle of Wadi Al Muggadam and is a traditional focal point for the Hawaweer. During the toughest period of the drought in the mid-1980s not many families remained in Um Jawasir, only women, children and old men. Some people reported that about 30 families stayed in Um Jawasir during the drought. In the whole Wadi Al Muggadam area, it is estimated that about 6,000 Hawaweer families remained in the valley while 20,000 families were displaced in the Nile area (Johnsen et al., 1996). The men went to seek work wherever they could. Many went north to the Nile region (Dongola, Korti, Merowe, Karima, Al Gorer), some went to camps in Omdurman, and some went to the Gulf (Saudi Arabia). When whole families migrated, the women also accepted wage work. Both men and women worked on farms; men also worked in construction and service, and women as domestic workers.\\nIt is estimated that 250,000 people starved to death as a result of the drought and famine in the Darfur and Kordofan states in northern Sudan during the period 1984-5 (Devereux, 2000). De Waal describes the disaster in Darfur and Kordofan as follows: 'Nimeiri's anti-famine strategy was simple: he denied that the problem existed  … an entirely preventable tragedy cost an estimated 250,000 lives ' (1997: 91). Accordingly, the Hawaweer became so-called environmental refugees during the mid-1980s. The famine experienced by the Hawaweer was triggered by rainfall failure and resulted in both rich and poor people losing their livelihoods and being forced to adjust their coping mechanisms. The recent Hawaweer experience is a story about going from drought, hunger, disaster and forced migration to relief, return, reconstruction and longterm development. In a way, it is remarkable how this successful post-famine and post-drought development has been possible in such a war-torn country as Sudan, which has largely been excluded from outside assistance except for relief support in the south and activities in support of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) moving from south to north. However, as in other war-torn societies, life goes on and development takes place all the same.\",\n",
       "  'From relief to post-drought development: the establishment of the Um Jawasir project': \"Today, large numbers of the Hawaweer continue to live as environmental refugees in the outskirts of major settlements along the Nile strip in the north of Sudan between Merowe and Dongola. They are not welcomed by the local communities and still consider themselves as belonging to the Wadi Al Muggadam, the homeland of the Hawaweer. The category 'environmental refugee' describes groups of people displaced as a result of environmental changes (Myers, 1993;Trolldalen et al., 1992;Lassailly et al., 1992). The term was first used by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1984-5 (Jacobsen, 1988;Ramlogan, 1996;Black, 1998). The term is broad enough to include migration attributed to climate change and rainfall failure. Environmental refugees are defined as people who have been forced to leave their traditional habitat, temporarily or permanently because of a marked environmental disruption (natural and/or triggered by people) that jeopardises their existence or seriously affects their quality of life (El-Hinnawi, 1985: 4). Many migration and refugee specialists and agencies now explicitly reject the term environmental refugees (McGregor, 1994). This is not because the problem of environmental degradation does not exist, but because the term is used in much the same way as economic migrant as a form of distress migration (Suhrke, 1994). At the same time, stress on the environment as an underlying cause tends to take the attention away from other factors of great importance, usually socio-political ones (Ramlogan, 1996;O'Lear, 1997). Environmental refugee as a term is, today, basically perceived as a way of simplifying the understanding of a situation that is usually much more complex than what can be illustrated by environmental explanations (McGregor, 1994). For example, Kibreab (1997) argues that the term environmental refugee was invented at least in part to depoliticise the causes of displacement. The categorisation of the Hawaweer as environmental refugees was appropriate in the sense that they were put on the agenda of international NGOs providing relief to people in northern Sudan in 1984-5.\\nRelief activities directed towards the Hawaweer were phased out in 1986 and followed by rehabilitation planning. Personnel at the University of Khartoum were contracted by UNEP in 1985 to undertake a feasibility study and found that Wadi Al Muggadam possesses a rich fresh-water aquifer at a reasonable depth and soil of sufficient quality for irrigated agriculture (ADRA, LUDCA and IES, 1999). After a long period of planning, trying and failing, the Um Jawasir project funded by ADRA/NORAD emerged in 1994. The project is based on irrigated agriculture and provides user rights to selected Hawaweer pastoralists to cultivate small irrigated plots with wheat, beans, dates, alfalfa, onions, okra and watermelons. First, 40 farms, each of two feddans (0.84ha) were established and the first commercial crop was produced in the winter season of 1992 (before NORAD agreed to fund the whole project). In 1995, six new wells with diesel pumps and 72 new farms each of four feddans were established. Another extension started in 2000 with six more wells and 96 new farms. Responsibility for the wells and farms established in the two first phases of the project has been handed over to the Hawaweer. In addition to agricultural production, the irrigated crops have facilitated a substantial increase in animal production, both milk and meat, owing to increased availability of fodder.\\nA recent evaluation gave the project a favourable assessment and found that the irrigated agricultural activities in the project were financially sustainable and that both collective (revolving fund) and individual (livestock) savings were undertaken at a satisfactory level (Johnsen et al., 2000). However, the evaluation did find several problems, such as high family expenditure of direct beneficiaries, sand movement which has decreased the number of farms established during the first phase (shelterbelts of mesquite, Prosopis chilensis, have now been planted to resolve this problem), and that more time was needed than anticipated. About 110 families (almost 1,000 people) are farming in the project area, not counting the 96 new farms to be established in 2001. In addition, many Hawaweer without an irrigated plot are also attached to the project area in different ways (altogether about 10,000 people). Yet, this is just a small number of people in comparison with the number of Hawaweer who are in need of rehabilitation or integration with secure employment (20,000 Hawaweer families are displaced in the Nile area and a smaller proportion in Omdurman).\\nThe Um Jawasir project integrates crop and livestock production. Fodder is produced in the plots and used for feeding members' own animals as well as those sold to other pastoralists. The farm surplus is often used to invest in new animals. Instead of seasonal movement to Northern Kordofan, the Hawaweer prefer to remain closer to the project where water and fodder are available. The number of animals in the extended Um Jawasir area is still small because poorer Hawaweer with few animals were selected to receive irrigated land (ADRA, LUDCA and IES, 1999). In the past, the Hawaweer depended mainly on camels, sheep and goats, though to a limited extent they practised crop production in years of good rainfall. On average, rain-fed cultivation is only possible every 10th year when the flooding, in addition to the rainfall, is favourable for crop production. The growing season of 1999-2000 was marked by successful rain-fed sorghum production, which was positive for the livelihoods of both Hawaweer in the Wadi Al Muggadam as well as on displaced Hawaweer in the Nile region who had returned to the Wadi to cultivate ancestral land. There are different grazing wadis, places where rain-fed agriculture is undertaken and the Um Jawasir project area with irrigated agriculture.\",\n",
       "  'Forced migration and livelihood coping strategies': \"Internally displaced people are defined as individuals or groups who have been forced to flee or to leave their homes of habitual residence, particularly as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflicts, situations of generalised violence, violation of human rights or natural or man-made disasters; and who have not crossed an internationally recognised state border (UNICEF, 1997: 2). The Hawaweer clearly fall within these definitions of forced migrants and internally displaced people. Climate change and rainfall failure caused drought, hunger, livelihood breakdown, distress and forced migration. For many people, the choice was either to stay and starve to death or to go somewhere else in search of work opportunities. At the same time mobility and different kinds of migration have always been part of the Hawaweer's livelihood strategy. In addition, not all the Hawaweer perceived the situation as forced. Some people chose to stay behind. Among these, some were in a situation where migration was impossible because they did not have access to the necessary number of animals needed for migrating. For them, the reason for staying was not because they chose to, but because they were forced to (de Waal, 1988;Larsen, 2001). This shows that what was forced and not forced can vary within the same group of people. People can be both forced to stay or forced to migrate and at the same time there is a certain degree of choice related to both staying and migrating (Van Hear, 1998). Some people within the same group and situation can be more adversely affected by shocks and disasters than others and less able to cope. The poor are usually those hit hardest. Skeldon (1997) states that the very poor are generally excluded from migration opportunities. Accordingly, Van Hear (1998) stresses that it is the better-off who can afford the cost of migration.\\nIt was not new for the Hawaweer to migrate in search of work opportunities. They had always been mobile as part of their nomadic lifestyle and livelihood diversification. For decades, many Hawaweer had been seasonal labourers in the Nile area. Others had gone to Omdurman or the Gulf. Others again had been involved in trading of animals and gone to the borders of Chad and Egypt to trade camels. The Hawaweer were used to experiencing drought, but now many did not leave of their own free will but because of a desperate search for survival and an urgent need to feed their hunger-struck families. The practice of migration was old and well known, but the context was new and created different situations than previously experienced. The old coping strategy of seasonal labour migration was not sufficient to keep hunger away, nor was the nomadic lifestyle of trading animals and moving according to pasture opportunities. The Hawaweer's food supply had always been dependent upon their ability to exchange labour for wages and to sell animals in times of difficulty. However, during the drought the labour market was flooded by able workers willing to do anything. In the Nile area (3-4 days journey by camel; now there is a daily bus connection from Tamtam), the Hawaweer who had been used to finding manual work at reasonable wages were now faced with extreme difficulties in finding any. Elmekki (1999) reports similarly from the whole of northern Sudan, not only about the Hawaweer, but about the oversupply of labour generally, pointing out that migration began earlier than usual, that the rate had risen rapidly and that there was an increase in whole-family migration that indicates the large amount of stress involved. It should be noted, however, that it is difficult to measure the various types of migration (de Waal, 1988).\\nSeasonal migration had been regarded as a normal part of the Hawaweer's livelihood. This changed as more people migrated more permanently than previously. The labour resource that the Hawaweer represented in peak work seasons used to be appreciated by the Nile people. However, as the number of Hawaweer coming increased, the local communities gradually began to perceive them as a threat. As work opportunities diminished, the Hawaweer were increasingly faced with difficulties and humiliations. They had been an important and cheap labour supply in developing the commercial agricultural production in the Nile area (for example, date plantations) and the local Nile people had benefited from their presence. Cheap labour has also been important in agricultural development elsewhere in Sudan. Kok (1989) and Kuhlman (1990) document how cheap Ethiopian labour fuelled the expansion of commercial agriculture in eastern Sudan. Similarly, in southern Sudan, Ugandan refugees contributed to rural growth and market development.\\nFor the Hawaweer, social networks were of crucial importance to survival with regard to both employment opportunities and facilitating the possibility of return after the entire household had migrated. Families with migrant workers in the Gulf, established in the Nile area or in Omdurman, were less seriously affected than others. The number of animals owned was also an important factor at the start of the drought, but in time animals played a less important role as a coping strategy because their value fell dramatically. Elmekki (1999) reports that under normal circumstances the price of a goat would buy a sack of millet, while in 1991 the same sack required the sale of 20 animals. He concludes that possibilities of selling animals to buy grain were exhausted during the first year of famine and that Khartoum-based export companies increased their profit by a minimum of 1,000 per cent during the years of the drought. As one local Hawaweer leader expressed it, rich animal keepers lost all their stock and became servants in the north (Nile area). The Hawaweer sub-group of Harrarine were very badly hit because they owned mainly camels and preferred to survive in the open desert. Hawaweer sub-groups owning sheep and goats in addition to camels and who stayed where there was a bit more vegetation (not in the open desert area) fared less badly. Underlining the importance of social networks, entire households that migrated left animals with relatives or neighbours within the Hawaweer sub-groups as insurance for their return if the rainfall situation improved. These animals were cared for, multiplied and made it easier for people to return when the rains came back. The Hawaweer need livestock to be able to migrate from their homeland as well as to return to it.\",\n",
       "  'Facilitating successful return': \"A returnee considers the process to be more of a new beginning than a return to the past (Hammond, 1999). Many Hawaweer got the opportunity to return to their homeland in Wadi Al Muggadam, while others did not get it or did not take it. The choice of staying where forced migrants settle is as important as the right to return. Even within a group, what is best for some members might not be for others. Some people integrate more easily than others and are better able to create new livelihoods. The challenge is how to facilitate both the possibility of staying as well as the option of returning, and the main question in both situations is how to make a living (livelihood security). In poor areas, homecoming is indeed intertwined with livelihood security as a whole as well as access to health and education. Hammond (1999) states that repatriation has often meant a significant drop in the availability of health-care and educational services. She poses the question of why returnees should choose to forgo a higher standard of living for the pleasure of going back to their country of origin. There are three possible outcomes of forced migration: integration, resettlement or return to the homeland. All three are difficult. Usually, what is needed to make people want to return is formal provision of collective or public goods and services (Moser, 1998). However, the Hawaweer who decided to return were not so concerned about access to services within health and education. They were willing to take the risk that such facilities would be provided in due course. Other Hawaweer decided not to return because of children's schooling or health problems.\\nThe most important factor for the Hawaweer who did choose to return was new livelihood opportunities created at home based on traditional rights to land. Without these rights, as well as effective traditional institutions, the new opportunities would probably not have materialised. The Hawaweer have rights to their traditional homeland that are recognised by the government. The right to cultivate land follows the sub-ethnic groups and is regulated by customary law. Each Hawaweer sub-group is entitled to a fair share of the flooded and most fertile arable land. Rocks indicating property demarcations were used as boundaries (in the old days, a 'rock-throwing' principle was applied, distributing sub-group user rights to cultivate the land). As for grazing livestock, the pasture is available to all Hawaweer regardless of sub-ethnic membership. However, members of one Hawaweer sub-ethnic group cannot settle on the land of another group and enjoy the same rights. Drinking-water is freely accessible for both people and animals, but Hawaweer without appropriate rights are not allowed to dig a permanent well (moshra) in the area of another Hawaweer subgroup, although a temporary well (sefar) may be dug.\\nThere have been many efforts towards voluntary repatriation of displaced people. Some repatriation projects have, to a limited degree, been successful due to a whole range of different reasons. Getachew (1996) reports that UNCHR's repatriation and rehabilitation programme made several mistakes in relation to displacement and return of pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. UNCHR staff lacked knowledge and understanding of the local situation and no serious consultations with the returnees were carried out. Problems included inadequate resources, corruption, inadequate monitoring and decisions taken without preliminary or ongoing research. Successful return has proven difficult for many reasons. Repatriation is not only physical, but also social, economic and political. The reasons given by the Hawaweer for returning to Um Jawasir are closely tied to livelihood opportunities, such as to reclaim a farm (irrigated land), to cultivate a grandfather's land (both irrigated and rain-fed agriculture), to get a job (agricultural labour such as watering, digging of canals, harvesting), to get a technical job (operating pumps, tractors, grinding-mills), for marketing or trading purposes (consumer goods, sale of animals, crops and vegetables) (Moh, 1999).\\nWomen have also returned to Um Jawasir on their own as well as accompanying their husbands. Women have not yet received individual plots from the project, but several women are able to secure a livelihood or contribute to the family income by working on the land as labourers -by weeding, harvesting of wheat and beans, picking okra, harvesting sorghum, cutting alfalfa, threshing sorghum or by engaging in petty trading. In addition, the Um Jawasir project includes a women's component with micro-credit possibilities where women sew clothes, make soap and pasta for sale and home consumption, cultivate the land of the women's group, produce fodder, organise local markets and run a local school (Larsen, 2001).\\nWhen explaining why people returned to Um Jawasir (see livelihood opportunities above), most people will say that that they failed to find a sustainable source of income in the Nile area and their lives there were very poor. Accordingly, the reasons given for people not to return to Um Jawasir are also closely related to livelihood opportunity, including access to services. People have not returned because they did not receive an irrigated plot in the project; because they have a job in the Nile area; because their children are in good schools; because they prefer a more urban life; 14677717, 2002, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7717.00192 by Universität Wien, Wiley Online Library on [24/11/2025].

       "  'The feeling of belonging': 'The Hawaweer who returned to Um Jawasir were in many ways different from the ones who had left. New social positions, social differentiation, gender roles and patterns of behaviour had developed. The Hawaweer returned because they could claim rights in the area and because the Um Jawasir project provided the most secure livelihood option. Also, the categorisation of people as refugees and returnees is misleading because of constant movement. Migration had always been an integral part of survival. The categories refugee and returnee should be regarded as a continuum and not as clearly defined groups of people. The issue of geographic belonging is important in processes of migration and return. Stølen (2000) gave evidence of returnees in Guatemala who perceived that the place of belonging was where they found sustainable livelihoods. For the Hawaweer, the feeling of belonging is not necessarily connected to secure livelihoods. They feel they belong to one place and at the same time they might have their livelihood at another. Many Hawaweer feel they belong to Um Jawasir in Wadi Al Muggadam, but the Nile area is where they make their livings. The feeling of belonging should not necessarily be equated with secure livelihoods. People might choose to live where they have a secure livelihood, but this does not imply that they also feel that they belong to this place. In the Nile area, many Hawaweer would state a feeling of belonging to Um Jawasir, but because of livelihood opportunities and service facilities, they chose to stay in the Nile area.',\n",
       "  'What made it possible for Hawaweer to return?': \"It is difficult to estimate how many families returned to the Um Jawasir area after the drought; one reason being that the definitions of a person who stayed behind and a returnee overlap as opposite extremes in a continuum. Some people claim that in Um Jawasir only about 30 families actually stayed throughout the droughts, while others claim the number was much higher. The terms 'staying' and 'returning' are obviously difficult to apply to a nomadic group. Presently, the population of Hawaweer in and around Um Jawasir is about 10,000 people. There are more people in the Um Jawasir area today than before the serious drought of the 1980s; however, the number of animals is still fewer than it was before the drought. The establishment of the project resulted in many more Hawaweer returning than those being allocated irrigated plots. Agricultural activities create casual labour opportunities and provide fodder for the animals not only for people with irrigated plots, but also for extended groups of Hawaweer. Also, the rainfall situation during the last five years has been more favourable than during the worst years of the 1980s, which again, has enabled some Hawaweer to return. In 1998 there was good rain with flooding and rain-fed agricultural production; 1993 had some rain and 1999 was another good year. Below, some important factors contributing to the successful return are highlighted. \",\n",
       "  'Irrigated agriculture: based on local innovation and initiative': 'During the drought of the 1980s, a Hawaweer local leader dug a well with manual workers and bought a water pump. The purpose of the well was to provide irrigated water supply to the area where sorghum was usually cultivated during years of good rainfall and flooding (on average every 10th year) so that sorghum could be grown in periods of rainfall failure and severe hunger. The well was dug where the soil was most fertile and where the Hawaweer had traditional cultivation rights to the land. Unfortunately, the chief was not able to dig deeply enough to secure sustainable access to water. Later, more or less the same idea was applied by ADRA which established the irrigated agricultural development project, Um Jawasir in the middle of the Wadi Al Muggadam, knowing that irrigated agriculture was something in which the Hawaweer leadership had already invested time, effort and money. This local initiative demonstrated that the nomadic pastoralists were motivated to become involved in irrigated agriculture. ADRA also knew that the Hawaweer pastoralists were accustomed to practise rain-fed sorghum cultivation when given the opportunity; they sometimes cultivated crops irrigated from traditional wells; and many Hawaweer applied different agriculture practices as opposed to casual farm work in the Nile region to the north and other places in Sudan or the Gulf.',\n",
       "  'Recognition of traditional rights': 'ADRA did not choose the most fertile land that used to be cultivated during good rainfall and flooding as the Hawaweer local leader had done. In the area of the first hand-dug well used for irrigation, the land was distributed to the different Hawaweer sub-ethnic groups and families in a traditional rights system marked by rocks according to the rock-throwing principle. ADRA did not want to interfere in this system of traditional cultivation rights. Also the government did not want to provide land to a project which already had the traditional cultivation user-rights attached to it. In the traditional land rights system, each Hawaweer sub-group was entitled to a fair share of the flooded and most fertile land. When the project area was established, the land was selected using geological assessment and not by identifying the most fertile soil, which had individual cultivation user rights attached to it. The staff wanted to avoid individuals claiming traditional cultivation rights after it had been irrigated and distributed to needy Hawaweer. The project land was not only the homeland of the Hawaweer, but was also used as a common-property grazing land without individual user-rights to cultivate. The emphasis of understanding different types of traditional rights in relation to both grazing and cultivation made it possible to avoid conflicts in relation to land tenure and rights.\\nWhen the irrigated plots in the project were distributed, it was the local Hawaweer leaders, not the project staff, ADRA or the government, who decided the allocation. Each of the nine Hawaweer sub-ethnic groups was given a certain percentage of land to distribute among their members in accordance with the size of the group. Local leaders distributed the plots to needy male Hawaweer in accordance with the following criteria, developed jointly by the leaders: generosity (the farmer should be known as a generous person); have many dependants; and physical fitness for farming (strong and healthy).',\n",
       "  'Excellent leadership, efficient institutions and participatory approaches': \"Strong leadership was provided both by the Hawaweer and by the Um Jawasir project. The commitment of the ADRA/government project staff and the excellent leadership of the project, both contributed significantly to its success. However, what might have played an equally important role are the strong traditional Hawaweer institutions, leadership and social networks. The Hawaweer are divided into nine sub-ethnic groups (the Rubab, Harareen, Habasab, Salhab, Goudtab, Tamaseeh, Fazarab, Khamaseen, Mowalka) and each group is divided into lineages, important for social relations, rights, survival, politics and governance. The Harareen have the Nazeer who is like a 'king' for the Hawaweer as a whole. In addition, the Hawaweer local leaders constitute four Umdas, seven Sheiks and the Agawids -which consist of elder wise men. Added to the traditional Hawaweer leaders, the government has established a system of Popular Committees (PCs) which function as local governments with a wide mandate and authority, for example, the Popular Committees can fine and arrest people as well as set taxes. In addition, the mobile court is an important institution in local governance and conflict resolution. The different sub-ethnic groups provide members to the mobile court. As well as traditional and governmental institutions, the Um Jawasir project has established different committees to run the project in a participatory way. The most important committee is the farmers' committee, with the same members as the Popular Committee. Effective, traditional, local governmental and project institutions and organisations are the backbone of the successful implementation of the Um Jawasir project. This institutional set-up provided sufficient conflict resolution capacity to tackle problems when they emerged.\\nADRA, with NORAD funding, was willing to take the risk of digging wells for some nomadic people in the desert of northern Sudan, an area where no other donors were active. Without funds, the creation of new opportunities and the reconstruction of livelihoods would have been very difficult. The Hawaweer experience indicates that successful institutions at local level and a committed NGO may compensate for the problems of policy failure and lack of resources at national level given that funding is made available from the outside.\",\n",
       "  'Construction of secure livelihoods': 'The concept of sustainable livelihoods is defined as the means, activities, entitlements and assets by which people make a living including natural, social, human, physical and financial capital (Scoones, 1998;UNDP, 1999;Ellis, 1999;Carney, 1999;Haug, 1999). Carney (1998: 4) defines a sustainable livelihood as follows: a livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain and enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future, while not undermining the natural resource base. Those working on the Um Jawasir project have recognised that constructing livelihoods includes not only the creation of income opportunities through mobilisation of natural capital such as land, water and commonproperty resources. Also, social and human capital were recognised, mobilised and played a crucial role in livelihood construction, for example, social networks, traditional institutions, participation, local knowledge and human skills. In addition, physical capital such as schools, roads, clinics and markets were gradually included as well as financial capital (a revolving fund, camels, sheep and goats). To construct secure livelihoods, the project applied a strategy bringing together all these different elements and linking micro-level understanding of poverty, culture and resources to project implementation.',\n",
       "  'Post-drought development and multiple identities': \"'A poor person is somebody who does not have anything to give to guests.' (Hawaweer/Salhab elder in Wadi El Braiga, 2000).\\nAs stated above, the Hawaweer who returned to Um Jawasir did not seek to move backward in time to recapture a life they once had, but rather the opposite: to construct something new and better than what went before (Hammond, 1999). The aim of the Um Jawasir project is to rebuild local capacities for food production in a post-hunger effort to create sustainable livelihoods for as many Hawaweer as possible. In order to achieve this aim, the project has transformed nomadic pastoralists who practised successful rain-fed agriculture on average every 10th year, and who occasionally took on casual farm work in the Nile area, to semi-nomadic agro-pastoralists. The Hawaweer who irrigate plots in the Um Jawasir project tend to identify themselves as farmers although they are also pastoralists and several of them nomadic pastoralists. However, the patterns of movement have changed. In the past, the Hawaweer moved in large groups trading animals in exchange of sorghum, sugar and tea. Today, it has become common only to move as a family unit within a smaller geographical area. When Hawaweer are asked whether it is possible to be both a farmer and a nomad in their hearts, many will answer that it is better to be a farmer because they could not survive as a nomad, since this is just too risky. And they will tell about the rich Hawaweer nomads who lost all their animals and became servants in the Nile area. They will say that the sub-ethnic group of Rubab are the best farmers, but add that all Hawaweer are both farmers and nomads. The feeling of identity (pastoralist, farmer or both) is connected to livelihood opportunities. Having not survived as nomadic pastoralists, livelihood diversification has led to multiple belonging and identity. For the Hawaweer, it is not difficult to fit into more than one category. It is not a problem to be both a semi-nomadic pastoralist undertaking agriculture once in a while and a semi-settled agro-pastoralist moving every now and then. Multiple identities imply that the Hawaweer are able to combine being both a farmer and a nomad, which are the two 'extremes' at each end of the continuum. Most Hawaweer will fit somewhere in between these two categories and exactly where on the continuum will vary with time and opportunities.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'The Hawaweer case illustrates how post-drought development, despite unfavourable conditions at national as well as international level, has been possible among internally displaced pastoralists in the marginal drylands of northern Sudan. However, it is important to underline that what might work in one place might not necessarily work elsewhere. The main lessons learned are that the different actors involved in the Um Jawasir project were willing to take risks (for example, by introducing diesel pumps and irrigated agriculture to pastoral nomads in the middle of the Bayoda desert) and that appropriate technical solutions went hand in hand with local initiatives and priorities. This was done while recognising the importance of traditional rights and institutions and placing the main responsibility with the local Hawaweer leaders. The Um Jawasir project had to be a success because, as we were told by one of the local leaders, hunger and humiliation was the only other option.'},\n",
       " 13: {'abstract': 'Objectives By 2050, over 250 million people will be displaced from their homes by climate change. This exploratory case study examines how climate-driven migration impacts the health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors of Maasai in Tanzania. Increasing frequency and intensity of drought is killing livestock, forcing Maasai to migrate from their rural homelands to urban centers in search of ways to support their families. Little existing research investigates how this migration changes the way migrants think about health and make healthcare decisions. Methods This study used semi-structured qualitative interviews to explore migrant and non-migrant beliefs surrounding health and healthcare. Migrant and non-migrant participants were matched on demographic characteristics and location. Results Migrants emphasized the importance of mental health in their overall health perceptions, whereas nonmigrants emphasized physical health. Although non-migrants perceived more barriers to accessing healthcare, migrant and non-migrant help-seeking behaviors were similar in that they only sought help for physical health problems, and utilized hospitals as a last option. Conclusions These findings have implications for improving Maasai healthcare utilization, and for future research targeting other climate-driven migrant populations in the world.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': '',\n",
       "  'Climate-driven migration and health': \"By the year 2050, scientists predict that climate change will displace more than 250 million people from their homelands (McMichael et al. 2012). Increasing temperatures and frequencies of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms are turning people into ''environmental refugees'' (Jeacocke 2010). Because climate change causes environmental degradation, health problems, and destruction of economic resources, impacted populations move to places perceived to offer a better life (McMichael et al. 2012).\\nEnvironmental change vulnerability, which is a combined measure of a community's exposure to climatic change, its sensitivity to these changes, and its ability to adapt (Confalonieri et al. 2007;McLeman and Hunter 2010), is particularly high in Sub-Saharan African countries. These countries are projected to face intense effects of climate change (World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization 2012), and bear some of the largest global disease burdens. Furthermore, many countries in this region have insufficient infrastructure to handle large societal changes such as increased climate-driven migration (Confalonieri et al. 2007).\\nResearch has extensively explored the impacts of nonclimate-driven migration on the mental and physical health of individual migrants (McKay et al. 2003;Bhugra 2004), but has yet to investigate whether a climatic driver of migration will influence or alter those health impacts (McMichael et al. 2012). Climate-driven migrations are often internal, from rural areas to urban centers within the same country (McMichael et al. 2012). Generally, urban environments place migrants' physical and mental health at risk (Friel 2011). Many suffer from homelessness, joblessness, social marginalization, and food insecurity (McMichael et al. 2012). These life circumstances can result in health challenges, such as depression, malnutrition, and infectious disease (McMichael et al. 2012).\\nThe Maasai in Tanzania: a case study This case study explores these issues with a focus on climate-driven rural-to-urban migration of a sample of Maasai people in Tanzania. The Maasai are pastoralists living in rural regions of Tanzania and Kenya. Cultural traditions include male circumcision, polygamy, arranged marriage, and a period of warriorship for the males (Biswas-Diener et al. 2005). Rural Maasai live in bomas, groups of six to ten Maasai mud huts that have no running water or electricity and are isolated from urban society. Men own and care for the livestock, whereas women manage the household and care for the children. They speak a language unique in Tanzania, kimaasai, and rarely obtain formal secondary education (Coast 2002).\\nDroughts have been driving the Maasai in Tanzania out of their rural homelands and into urban areas. In a 2012 study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 81 % of Maasai migrants reported drought as the primary reason they moved into the city from their villages (Riley et al. 2012). Migration is driven by the loss of livestock, the main source of livelihood for Maasai people. Increased drought frequency and duration cause food and water shortages that render the Maasai incapable of sustaining their livestock, resulting in migration to cities in search of new opportunities. A common destination for Maasai migrants is the city of Arusha, which has a population of about 1 million (National Bureau of Statistics 2012) and is the largest tourist hub in Tanzania.\",\n",
       "  'Development of an illness behavior conceptual framework': \"This study explores Maasai migrant and non-migrant beliefs and behaviors related to seeking help for health problems. Illness behavior is an umbrella term encompassing human response to sickness and suffering (Sirri et al. 2013). It is the observation of the body, interpretation of symptoms, and formulation of a plan to improve one's health (Christakis et al. 1994). Help-seeking behavior is a subcategory of illness behavior. Help-seeking behavior is the act of seeking assistance or advice in response to a change in one's perceived health (Cornally and McCarthy 2011).\\nA conceptual framework of illness behavior (Fig. 1), which is a synthesis of several existing theories (Andersen 1995;Bailis et al. 2003;Leventhal et al. 2003;Jylha ¨2009), underpins this study. There are three main questions an individual answers in this framework: (1) Do I have a health problem? (2) Do I want to seek help? (3) From whom do I seek help?\\nAn internal or external input catalyzes the help-seeking process by making people attend to and evaluate their health statuses. Individuals must interpret these inputs to determine whether or not they have a health problem (Andersen 1995;Leventhal et al. 2003). Next, an individual must decide whether or not to seek help. Leventhal's Common Sense Model and Andersen's Socio-behavioral Model both assert that people constantly assess their own health and use those assessments to judge whether their health problems are of sufficient magnitude to seek help (Leventhal et al. 2003;Andersen 1995). Lastly, in developing countries, one usually decides between traditional healers and biomedicine (Kroeger 1983;Christakis et al. 1994). Many personal, environmental, and societal factors influence these decisions, as shown in Fig. 1.\",\n",
       "  'Research questions': 'Using semi-structured qualitative interviews guided by the illness behavior conceptual framework presented in Fig. 1, this research focused on understanding and comparing the health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors of Maasai migrants and non-migrants. Little to no research has been done on illness behaviors of the Maasai, so it was necessary to build a foundation of knowledge using a rich qualitative methodology.\\nThis case study utilizes a matched sample of migrant and non-migrant Maasai to explore the following research questions: (1) how, if at all, do perceptions of what it means to be healthy differ between climate-driven Maasai migrants living in a developed urban setting and non-migrant Maasai living in a traditional rural village setting?

       "  'Selection of study sample': \"Interviews were conducted in two demographically matched Maasai populations: rural-to-urban migrants and permanent rural residents (i.e., non-migrants).\\nMigrant participants (8 males, 6 females) were recruited in Arusha, Tanzania. Most Maasai men in Arusha migrated from Longido district, which is the most isolated Maasai district. At a community meeting in Arusha, a purposeful sample of eight Maasai men was selected using the study's inclusion criteria: each male participant must be Maasai, living in Arusha, over 18 years old, and from Longido district.\\nMost female Maasai migrants originated from Simanjiro district. The project coordinator and translator recruited female participants (n = 6) by visiting them at their work places and explaining the study goals. Inclusion criteria were the same as for male migrants, except all female participants originated from Simanjiro district.\\nNon-migrant interviews took place in rural villages in Longido district for men (n = 8), and Simanjiro district for women (n = 6). None of the non-migrant participants had ever migrated to an urban area, and were purposefully chosen to have similar demographic characteristics to the migrant participants (Table 1). The two samples were matched based on socioeconomic indicators in the Maasai culture: age group, gender, number of wives, number of children, marital status, number of siblings, and education (Riley et al. 2012).\",\n",
       "  'Data collection': \"Data collection spanned 8 weeks during July and August 2013, and consisted of 28 qualitative interviews. The major part of the interview consisted of open-ended questions that explored the participant's beliefs surrounding health and help seeking. This open-ended section of the interview was constructed based on the literature and guided by the newly developed illness behavior theoretical framework. Table 2 shows example interview questions and the full interview protocol is given in Online Resource 1.\\nPrior to recruiting study participants, all interview questions were reviewed by the Maasai project coordinator to ensure that the questions were culturally and linguistically appropriate. A pilot interview with a migrant Maasai man in Arusha resulted in revisions to the interview protocol.\\nAll interviews used the same Maasai translator. Participants chose whether to speak Maasai or Swahili, and all but one chose to speak Maasai. Each migrant participant received a drink and/or a meal and each non-migrant participant received a blanket in thanks for their participation. These gifts were financially equivalent and were decided upon based on the greatest needs of the participants.\",\n",

       "  'Data organization and analysis': 'All interviews were audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed, and compiled in NVIVO 10 qualitative data analysis software. Data analysis was guided by inductive and deductive thematic approaches (Miles et al. 2013). The researchers developed a coding framework containing both external and internal codes. Codes external to the study stemmed from previous research, while internal grounded codes prioritized the voice and perspective of the study participants. Codes  Have you ever gone to the hospital?

Why did you decide not to go or why were you unable to go?\\nwere applied to the transcripts in two passes. The first pass codes were categorical codes that served as the highest thematic level of coding. Second pass coding consisted of subcodes for the first pass categorical codes to add specificity and depth to the identified themes. Throughout the iterative process of coding and categorizing, analytic memos were used to explore possible connections between themes and subthemes, allowing the formulation of propositions through the constant comparison method (Glaser 1965). Assertions and propositions were tested using matrices and other data displays (Miles et al. 2013). Negative case analysis helped to verify conclusions made from propositions and assertions (Bernard and Ryan 1998).',\n",
       "  'Findings': '',\n",
       "  'Driving forces of migration': \"Although it was expected that both men and women migrated to Arusha due to climate change, interviews revealed that this was only true for male migrants. All Maasai migrants in this study were driven to migrate by the need for money to support their families. However, male and female migrants in this study were differentially driven to seek out monetary income (Fig. 2). In accordance with the literature, droughts drove men to migrate, because the dry climate killed the men's livestock, and left them with no livelihood. In contrast, women were driven to become the family breadwinners when their male providers either died or became unable to work. When their husbands had few livestock, the women looked for business opportunities in Arusha to support their families, such as selling jewelry, tobacco, and tea. Both male and female migrants left their families at home in the villages, and sent remittances to pay for more livestock, food, school fees, and healthcare.\\nDespite having different reasons for migrating, male and female migrant participants had very similar beliefs surrounding health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors. Hence, further findings of this study will not be segregated by gender.\",\n",
       "  'Differences in perceptions of what it means to be healthy': \"All migrant and non-migrant participants identified both mental and physical health in their constructs of health (Fig. 3). Within mental health, study participants believed that a healthy person is both happy and has low levels of stress. Mostly, participants referred to being happy as a direct result of feeling no stress. A migrant woman said, ''thinking and stress and worries, that is not healthy'' (#14, migrant female).\\nParticipants identified three important aspects of physical health: being energetic and strong, having a healthy weight, and not feeling sick. Study participants believed that ''when you are healthy, you have energy, are strong, it means you can work'' (#26, non-migrant male). Furthermore, most participants discussed a healthy weight by saying, ''health means being huge, fat'' (#12, migrant female). Lastly, participants acknowledged that a healthy person is ''not sick and doesn't have any illness in his body'' (#15, non-migrant female). Across all participants, feeling ill always indicated poor health, but lack of illness did not necessarily indicate good health if the person did not meet the other three criteria of energy/strength, healthy weight, and lack of stress.\\nWhile all participants identified these four aspects of health, migrants placed more importance on mental health and non-migrants on physical health in their perceptions of what it means to be healthy (Fig. 3). When asked about ideal health, health goals, and extremely healthy individuals, Climate-driven migration: an exploratory case study of Maasai health perceptions and help… 645 migrants discussed lack of stress much more often than being energetic, strong, and sick, whereas non-migrants talked about the importance of good physical health more often than the importance of good mental health.\",\n",
       "  'Differences in perceived health problems': 'Migrant participants struggled with mental health problems like stress, unhappiness, and loneliness more than did nonmigrant participants. Maasai in Arusha attributed their poor mental health to shouldering large responsibility, feeling trapped and hopeless, lacking social support, and feeling homesick.',\n",
       "  'Responsibility': \"Migrant participants felt a more intense and urgent sense of responsibility to provide for their families than did non-migrant participants. All migrant participants moved to Arusha in search of income to support their families at home. Many were solely responsible for providing for their wives, children, parents, and/or siblings, and they felt intense anxiety over being able to provide for them. A migrant man reflected on his stress surrounding his family's well-being:\\nI feel like an elder and more responsible, I have been thinking about my wives, that they live well and eat well, and now I have children. I think of and worry about them all the time, that they go to school and eat well, and just to think about how I can make their lives comfortable. If I start thinking about all those things, I feel unhealthy because of worries about making life comfortable for my family.\\n(#8, migrant male)\\nWhile non-migrants mentioned feeling responsibility and some anxiety surrounding their families' well-being, they did not emphasize it as much as migrants did. Migrant participants discussed responsibility, stress, and unhappiness more frequently than did non-migrants, and with greater intensity.\",\n",
       "  'Lack of social support': \"Lacking social support and being far from home contributed to the poor mental health of male migrant participants. Migrant men felt homesick, missed their families, worried about the states of their children or siblings at home, and all had the ultimate goal of moving home. When the men returned home, they said it was ''the only time they felt fresh again'' (#3, migrant male). Home provided the social support they were missing, they got to see their livestock, and they were able to sleep peacefully. Being away from family in the stressful living conditions of Arusha made them feel isolated and lonely.\\nSome men described getting angry when their employers did not allow them to go home, and many voiced having had feelings of losing hope and wanting to give up and go home. Almost all migrant male participants worked as night guards for residences in Arusha. Night guard work is stressful because the men are accountable to their employers for anything that gets stolen or broken, and there is always the threat of dangerous thieves that will ''slaughter and cut you all over'' (#4, migrant male). However, the men feel trapped in Arusha, with no other way to provide for their families. While home provides social support, moving home without income would place them in the stressful situation that forced them to migrate in the first place. This no win cycle enhances a feeling of hopelessness and lack of control for migrant men specifically.\\nMigrant women did not discuss feeling homesick as often as migrant men. This could be because women had a stronger sense of community in Arusha. They all worked together during the days and slept in a rented room together at night. Additionally, they had more freedom to travel home, since they were self-employed selling jewelry, tea, and snuff. and symptoms such as pain, swelling, fever, cough, and chest pain. Notably, neither migrant, nor non-migrant participants cited stress or depression as internal inputs that catalyzed a help-seeking response. They emphasized that improved life circumstances, not healthcare treatment, would alleviate mental health challenges.\\nFrom whom do I seek help?\\nAlthough herbal and western medicines were both used, migrant and non-migrant participants agreed upon an order in which they were normally sought out. Herbal medicine was almost always the first line of treatment for a health problem. This type of traditional medicine makes someone ''have diarrhea and vomit and it gets all the dirt out'' (#3, migrant male). If the herbal medicine was ineffective, and the person continued to feel sick or got worse, then he or she would go to the hospital. Consequently, hospitals were used as a last resort treatment.\",\n",
       "  'Factors that influence help-seeking decisions': 'While this chronology of treatment usage remained constant between migrants and non-migrants, non-migrants perceived more barriers to accessing western healthcare. Both migrants and non-migrants identified long wait times and distrust as barriers to accessing western healthcare, but non-migrants also discussed transport cost, distance to the hospital, healthcare cost, and resource shortages at hospitals and clinics as barriers (Fig. 4).',\n",
       "  'Discussion': \"The results of this exploratory case study illuminate a mismatch between Maasai migrants' perceived health problems and health perceptions, and their help-seeking behaviors. Migrants suffered more from mental health issues and placed higher importance on mental health, but they continued to only seek help for physical health problems. Additionally, migrant participants perceived fewer barriers to accessing western healthcare, and yet still reported using clinics and hospitals as a last option. Findings also revealed that male migrants are climate driven, but female migrants are driven by the lack of a male provider. Hence, these results have implications for both climate-driven male migrants and financially driven female migrants. Implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed below.\",\n",
       "  'Emphasis on mental health': 'The trauma migrants experienced may partially explain why migrants emphasized the importance of having good mental health more than non-migrants did. Individuals tend to construct their ideal health state based on the current challenges they are facing (Gollwitzer and Oettingen 1998). Migrants felt lonely, isolated, homesick, and anxiety ridden in Arusha, which led them to place a higher importance on feeling happy and less stressed. A study of Ethiopian refugees in the UK revealed similar findings: refugees valued happiness and overall well-being much more than their non-refugee Ethiopian counterparts (Papadopoulos and Lay 2003). The study attributed this shift in health perception to the increased personal trauma and isolation faced by refugees. Similarly in this study, it is likely that difficult migration experiences resulted in poor mental health for migrants, which brought mental health to the forefront of their ideal health states.',\n",
       "  'Healthcare underutilization': \"Although reducing the social inequities and hardships that lead to these mental health problems is important in the long run, health care resources available now to migrant Maasai in Arusha could greatly improve their mental and physical well-being if more extensively utilized. Several possible explanations exist for why migrant participants used western healthcare in Arusha as a last resort and only for physical maladies. First, migrants may not have been aware of the healthcare options available to them. Arusha has many hospitals and clinics, and the Arusha Mental Health Trust provides free psychiatric health services as well as psychological counseling to underprivileged people in the city. However, new migrants may not know about these options, and therefore not utilize them. Future research needs to investigate the level of knowledge Maasai migrants have about their local healthcare options. Stigma may also be preventing migrants from mental health resources in particular. Although no research has been done on the use of mental healthcare in the Maasai population, existing research from other countries shows that both self and public stigma can prevent an individual from seeking help for mental health problems. Individuals do not want to label themselves as having a mental illness, and also do not want to receive that label from society (Corrigan 2004). Furthermore, research shows that minority ethnic groups who are already confronted with prejudice and discrimination, such as the Maasai in Arusha, suffer increased stigma when faced with mental illness (Gary 2005).\\nLastly, some participants referred to the ''cure'' for poor mental health as being improved life circumstances, such as increased wealth. Maasai may believe that healthcare treatments would not have any effect on their mental health. They perceive poor mental health as a result of stressful or negative life circumstances. The only way to feel better is to increase the quality of their everyday lives.\\nFuture research needs to investigate if, and how, these themes contribute to the underutilization of healthcare resources by Maasai migrants, thereby enhancing efforts to make available healthcare more attractive and relevant to Maasai migrants.\",\n",
       "  'Mental Health Interventions in Arusha': \"The increase in migrant mental health challenges and the emphasis migrant participants placed on mental health indicate that mental health interventions could be effective in this population. Interventions could focus on educating migrants about available mental health services, the benefits they would provide, and their accessibility.\\nAdditionally, interventions might introduce mental health services targeted directly towards the Maasai migrants in Arusha. These services could be communitybased programs, which recruit and train Maasai community members to provide psychological counseling to Maasai migrants that is both culturally and linguistically appropriate. Tsai's research on Asian Americans in the US shows that mental health services need to be tailored to the cultural perceptions of ideal mental health states, as these perceptions can differ greatly across cultures (Tsai 2007). It would also therefore be important to understand Maasai perceptions of mental health more thoroughly to formulate effective interventions.\\nMutual aid societies are a more prevention-oriented intervention. Migrant participants struggled with homesickness, loneliness, and feeling isolated. Having a formal and consistent setting in which they could go for support, and to identify and solve problems, could positively influence their mental health. Maasai men in Arusha meet every week to discuss personal, financial, and health-related problems. This meeting could be extended to all Maasai in Arusha, or a new setting, such as a community center, could be established.\",\n",
       "  'Implications for research and policy': 'Overall, the findings of this study have implications for both future science and policy. The methodology used in this study can be used to study migration, health perceptions, and help-seeking behaviors in other vulnerable populations. Specifically, future research should investigate reasons for healthcare underutilization by Maasai migrants in urban regions. Policy makers should implement appropriate interventions to improve the mental health of Maasai migrants.',\n",
       "  'Strengths and limitations': 'The thoughtful and scientifically rigorous research methodology has several strengths. First, the project had a strong community partner who integrated the researchers into the community, and enhanced the cultural acceptability of the interview protocol. Second, the migrant and non-migrant samples were matched on demographic characteristics and location. This allowed for stronger conclusions to be drawn about the influence of migration on health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors. Lastly, the study is context specific. Few existing studies have gone into this amount of depth with the Maasai population. These aspects of the study design enhanced the confidence associated with the conclusions made.\\nHowever, this study had some potential limitations. Due to limited funding, the research was a small convenience sample. The exploratory findings and implications should be further investigated and verified through research using larger and more systematic samples. Another possible limitation arose from the use of a translator. Threats to validity when using a translator exist if the translator does not have full understanding of the research project, or has biased ideas about the research (Kapborg and Bertero 2002). To address this challenge, training was conducted to familiarize the translator with the research aims and the interview protocol, and to ensure that he would translate questions verbatim during each interview. Additionally, the Maasai project coordinator periodically checked the translations to improve reliability and validity.',\n",
       "  'Conclusion': \"This case study illuminates the ways in which rural-tourban migration can influence migrant health perceptions, perceived health problems, and healthcare decisions. Given the recent refugee crisis in the European research related to migrants' individual level health perceptions and behaviors is timely and important. The climate is changing at unprecedented rates, and rates of financially driven ruralto-urban migration are climbing. Many refugee health program services are exclusively offered to political refugees, disregarding the plights of climate refugees and within-country migrants (Biermann and Boas 2010). Further research is needed to inform policies and interventions that will mitigate the impacts of increasing rural-to-urban migration in developing countries.\",\n",

       " 14: {'abstract': 'This study analyses the factors that cause inter-provincial migrations in an African context (Burkina Faso, West Africa), focusing specifically on the role of environmental factors in driving large migration flows in ecologically marginal regions. It uses statistical methods for modelling migration data to assess the relative importance of socio-demographic and biophysical variables. The former included the percentage of the population who are male, literacy and economic activity rates, and the presence of a resettlement policy. The latter included measures of land degradation, land availability and climatic variability, which vary considerably between different regions of the country. The results demonstrate that, as expected, demographic and socio-economic characteristics of Provinces were associated with migration patterns, and that environmental variables were also significant. However, the contribution of environmental variables in the explanation of migration was slightly lower than for the socio-demographic variables. The results show that inter-provincial migrations in Burkina Faso are influenced by high literacy and economic activity rates at the origin and destination, a high proportion of men at the origin, a low proportion of men at the destination, as well as by unfavourable conditions concerning rainfall variability, land degradation and land availability at the origin, and favourable conditions at the destination for these variables.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"In some regions of West Africa, the economic and social effects of large-scale inor out-migration are significant. In Burkina Faso for example, due to migration, the population growth rate in the savannah region was reduced by 1.1% while, in the forest region, it increased by 0.6% (Zachariah & Conde, 1981). The regions of departure lose labour force while the social and economic infrastructures in regions of arrival may have problems keeping up with the rapidly growing population. Migration may also increase the risk of land conflicts between migrants and longer-term residents. Adding to the difficulty of their resettlement, rural migrants often receive the less productive and most vulnerable land to cultivate. High migration rates therefore create an additional challenge for spatial planning efforts, as there is a need to predict migration flows. However, migration is usually ignored in models of land use change (Stephenne & Lambin, 2001;Shen, 2000;Verburg, Veldkamp, & Fresco, 1999), even though it is often recognized to be the dominant demographic factor influencing land use (Lambin et al., 2001). Consequently, improving our predictive ability of migration in an African context will benefit spatial planning agencies who need to anticipate large and sudden migration flows.\\nMigration in West Africa is known to be related to a variety of demographic and socio-economic variables, such as local marriage rates, population age-sex structure, education levels, incomes, and fertility and mortality rates (Cordell, Gregory, & Piche ´, 1996;OCDE and CILSS, 1998;Ouattara, 1998;Sivamurthy, 1982;Zachariah & Conde, 1981). Basic models of migration flows are often based on the gravity theory (Ravenstein, 1889;Zipf, 1946). The origin and destination populations and the distance between each pair of places are the three variables used to explain migration in such models. Other explanatory variables can then be added to represent various factors such as origin and destination educational levels, job opportunities, level of urbanisation, population density, wage levels, etc. (Barber & Milne, 1988;Brown & Goetz, 1987;Flowerdew, 1991;Gordon & Molho, 1998;Gordon & Vickerman, 1982). Fewer examples of models can be found that include variables that reflect planning policies, land tenure, market prices and environmental factors even though these are known to influence migration.\\nMost of the literature on migration in Africa has focussed on the characteristics of migrants (Dallaire, 1978;INSD, 1991;Lututala, 1995) and while considerable advances have been made in models designed to explain variations in regional migration, they have yet to be applied in developing world contexts. Early examples of migration modelling in Africa include the adjustment model developed by Lewis (1954), which used economic differences between the origin and destination to explain migration flows. Others have suggested that migrants are attracted by the 'bright lights' of cities (e.g. Deniel, 1968). More recently, Shen (1999) developed interprovincial migration models in China. Whilst Ma and Liaw (1997) used a two-level nested logit model to explain the migration behaviour of young adults in China, discerning the probabilities of departure and of chosing a particular destination.\\nIn Africa, most studies have been concerned with migratory movements from rural to urban areas, including work using system approaches (Mabogunje, 1970), and by analysing root causes of migration such as the class position of migrants, geographical features, historical developments and demographic structures (Shrestha, 1988). However, no model to date has integrated a mixture of demographic, socio-economic and biophysical variables in an African context. This is despite the growing assumption that the environment is becoming increasingly important in explaining large-scale movements of migrants, some of whom have been described as environmental refugees (Do ¨o ¨s, 1997; Myers, 1997;Myers & Kent, 1995;Ramlogan, 1996). For example, the vulnerability to food shortages was shown to contribute significantly to out-migration in ecologically degraded and drought-prone regions of Ethiopia (Ezra & Kiros, 2001). Migrations driven by rapidly changing environmental factors are likely to be more massive and rapid than migrations driven by slower socio-demographic changes. On 16 June 2002, on the occasion of the World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that ''135 million people who depend primarily on land for their livelihood are at risk of being displaced''. The Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently claimed that ''in 1998, 25 million people were forced from their homes for environmental reasons'' (Pachauri, 2002).\\nWhile the view that environmental factors play a major role in migration is now increasingly taken for granted, it largely remains untested as a hypothesis in the African migration modelling literature. In particular, the relative role of environmental and socio-demographic factors in driving migration has never been assessed for the regions where large numbers of environmental refugees are claimed to exist. If the link between environmental change and migration was proven statistically, the case for including environmental variables in migration models would be strong and this would be especially the case in Africa where inter-regional differences in environmental attributes can be large. However, reliable regional information on demographic, socio-economic and biophysical factors in Africa, collected for consistent geographical zones and over similar periods of time, is rarely available. The aim of this study is to analyse the causes of inter-provincial migration in Burkina Faso. It also evaluates the relative importance of socio-demographic and environmental variables in driving migration in Burkina Faso, using a statistical modelling approach.\\nThis study has access to unique information from Burkina Faso allowing us to test the relative influence of demographic and socio-economic variables compared to variations in rainfall, land degradation and land availability. More specifically: do Provinces with more abundant and more regular rainfall attract migrants from Provinces with less favourable climatic conditions? Are migrants more likely to move from areas with severely degraded soils towards regions with more fertile land? Does land availability in Provinces at the origin and destination influence   3. AGE is the number of the 15-64 year old people divided by the total population. AGE, LITER, MALE, ACTIVE and CULTAREA are percentages. migration? And how important are these variables compared to other socio-demographic variables that are well known to influence migration?\",\n",
       "  'Study area': \"In the 1985 population census, 7,964,705 individuals were recorded in Burkina Faso, 51.9% of them being women. The age structure of the population was relatively young with 47.9% of people less than 15 years old and only 3.7% of people aged 65 and over.\\nThe literacy rate varied from 4% to 45% according to the Province. The urban and western Provinces had the highest literacy rates (Table 1). The Centre-North Provinces differed from the rest of the country with relatively low rates of economic activity, lower percentages of males in the population, a low representation of people aged 15-64, and a high percentage of cultivated area. As for many African countries, the urban system in Burkina Faso is composed of a small number of large cities (Ouagadougou, the capital in the Kadiogo Province, and Bobo Dioulasso, in the Houet Province) and by many secondary towns. The cotton region is located in the west and south-west of the country. Burkina Faso has a gradient of rainfall conditions, from the Sahelian environment in the North where rainfall is sparse and irregular to the south-western region where rainfall is higher and more regular (Fig. 1).\\nThe Network for Migration and Urbanisation in West Africa (REMUAO) carried out a large survey in 1993 for eight West African countries (Bocquier & Traore, 2000). In terms of international migration analysis, their study highlighted the diversity of factors that influence migration in West Africa, although whether the country was landlocked and the presence of primate cities were shown to have a particularly influential impact on international migration. Both of these attributes are relevant in Burkina Faso. Indeed, Burkina Faso is the only one of the eight West African countries with a positive migratory balance, mainly because of return migrants from Co ˆte d'Ivoire (Traore & Bocquier, 1996).\\nThe Burkinabe are known to be very mobile people compared to those in other West African countries. During the colonial period, severe recruitment policies forced many people to migrate from their villages to work for public and private colonial interests. Internal migration, although minor compared to international migration, played an important role by contributing to urban growth in colonial Burkina Faso. Between 1975 and 1985, the relative importance of internal migration seems to have increased slightly in comparison to migration from abroad (Cordell, Gregory, & Piche ´, 1996). In 1985, 4% of the population migrated during the previous twelve months, 2% of these movements being within the country.\\nThe population census survey of 1985 reported only inter-Provincial movements. The largest migratory flows between 1984 and 1985 left Kadiogo (the Province of Ouagadougou) for its neighbouring Provinces (Fig. 1). The exchange between Houet (the Province of Bobo Dioulasso), and both the capital and the Yatenga Province were also substantial. This latter Province also sent a large number of migrants to the Kossi Province. Kadiogo had the highest emigration rate (6.41%), followed by Houet (2.79%) and three Centre-North Provinces: Soum (2.69%), Sanmatenga (2.04%) and Yatenga (2.00%) (see Table 2). For these latter Provinces, with an economy based mostly on agriculture and with difficult agro-ecological conditions, out-migration of the agricultural labour force can have adverse economic consequences. The five highest immigration rates concerned the Sissili (4.88%), Kadiogo (3.36%), Bam (2.60%), Bazega (2.53%) and Mouhoun (2.20%) Provinces. With large numbers of immigrants, these Provinces face difficulties related to land conflicts and access to social infrastructures. Overall, disparities within Burkina Faso with regard to migration were considerable: net migration figures show that Kadiogo lost 14,031 individuals between 1984 and 1985, and Sissili gained 8809 people through migration. These geographically diverse migration dynamics pose many challenges for land use planning in Burkina Faso.\\nWhile the Central Plateau is densely populated with a highly variable rainfall (Tallet, 1993), the southwest of the country is less populated and benefits from higher and more regular rainfall. After some years of drought, families from the Centre-North plateau had begun to migrate towards the southwest. In addition, in 1974 Burkina Faso developed the 'Ame ´nagement des Valle ´es des Voltas' (AVV) program to open up the valleys of the Volta rivers which had been freed from onchorcercosis (Guiella, 1996;Sidibe, 1986). Large spontaneous population movements swelled in the villages adjacent to the official migration areas and traditional land tenure systems, based on the principle of hospitality, facilitated the settlement of migrants (Totte ´, 1994). As a consequence, the population of some villages in the southwest has more than doubled in 20 years. The effects of this migration-driven population growth on land use were quickly visible. The newcomers tend to reproduce the same extensive farming practices followed in the centre-north and, encouraged by large private companies, are keen to produce cotton and maize (Gray, 1999). The land requirement for migrants is thus larger than for the sedente population, and land supply is being exhausted rapidly (Mathieu, 1993).\",\n",
       "  'Data': \"The demographic data were extracted from the population census survey of 1985 (INSD, 1991) which provides reasonably comprehensive information for the whole country. More recent national scale data were not available when this study was conducted. During the census, which lasted about ten days, interviewers visited households and administered a questionnaire to the household head who responded for the other members of the household. Only Province-level data were made available. Here we use the information on migration which compares people's address at the time of the census and one year previously, in 1984. International and seasonal migrations were therefore ignored in this dataset. The former are mostly related to short-term economic opportunities in Co ˆte d'Ivoire (i.e., young men working in large plantations for a couple of years) and the latter have always been part of livelihood strategies in the Sahelian region. This provided a matrix of 870 flows between the 30 Provinces of Burkina Faso, intra-Province flows were ignored. In total, 135,527 migrants moved between these Provinces out of a total population of 7,964,705 recorded in the 1985 census.\\nThe explanatory variables used in the model are presented in Table 3. The standard demographic population and distance variables were included, as well as a number of social, economic and demographic variables. The distance variable was computed between population-weighted centroids derived for each Province. Since the flows between neighbouring areas are often higher than expected in such migration models, a contiguity variable was also introduced. The African migration literature suggests that migrants are more often economically active males with high literacy rates. The percentage of males in the total population, the percentage of economically active people and the literacy rate were therefore included in the list of explanatory variables. In addition, the percentage unemployed, the percentage of single people aged 12 and above, and the percentage of people living in an urban area were also included. A dummy variable was used to denote the AVV migration areas. In many studies, age is the most important personal determinant of the migration intensity and direction. However, this variable was excluded of this study because of multicollinearity with the other socio-demographic variables and as it was suspected to be endogeneous to the model. As fertility rates are very similar between Provinces the age structure was influenced mostly by migration. Age was not therefore used as an explanatory variable in the migration model.\\nSeveral climatic and land degradation variables were also introduced in the model. In Sahelian and Sudanian regions, crop yields are mostly controlled by the amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season and we would expect that poor harvests would have driven some households to migrate further south (Grouzis & Albergel, 1989;Sicot, 1989). The mean rainfall values for 10-day periods during the rainy season of 1983-84 for each Province were therefore added to the model to quantify spatial variations in rainfall. For crop yields, rainfall distribution during the growing season is almost as important as the total annual rainfall. Therefore, the number of decades during the rainy season of 1983-84 with a deviation from the mean rainfall of more than 50% compared to the 1960-98 mean rainfall for the corresponding decade was also computed. Finally, as the decision to migrate may only be made after a succession of negative climatic  1993).\",\n",

An index of land degradation, derived from the GLASOD map (Global Assessment of Human Induced Soil Degradation, UNEP, 1990) which is available at the 1:10,000,000 scale, was therefore introduced in the model. The map was based on a serie of indicators of soil degradation and, for each Province, an average value of degradation severity was extracted. The severity of degradation can be considered as exogenous to migration since the increase in population pressure in areas of destination is only likely to affect soil fertility over a few decades.\\nTwo additional environmental variables which are likely to influence migration are crop yields, as a function of rainfall, and land availability for cultivation. The variable 'yields for cotton in 1984' was introduced in the model as this crop is very sensitive to climate conditions and offers opportunities for cash revenues. The proportion of the total area of each Province which was already under cultivation ('percentage of cultivated area') was introduced to estimate the amount of land potentially available for agricultural expansion by migrants. Note that these two variables are not exclusively environmental but capture some socio-economic factors as well (e.g., input use, potential for revenues from cash crops, population density, agricultural intensity).\",\n",
       "  'Methods': 'Models of inter-regional migration flows are generally based on gravity theory (Ravenstein, 1889;Zipf, 1946). Migration is expected to be positively related to the population in the origin and destination, and negatively related to the distance between the two places. As the flows are counts of migrants, and the matrix will often be characterised by many null, several low, and few high values, a Poisson regression model is appropriate (Flowerdew & Lovett, 1989;Boyle & Flowerdew, 1993). A Generalised Linear Modelling (GLM) framework was used which allows additional explanatory variables, along with the standard gravity model variables, to be included. Examples used previously have included educational levels, job opportunities, level of urbanisation, population density, wage levels, etc. (Barber & Milne, 1988;Brown & Goetz, 1987;Flowerdew, 1991;Gordon & Molho, 1998;Gordon & Vickerman, 1982). In developed world examples, at least, environmental variables are rarely included, although Gordon and Molho (1998) included subjective preferences for different residential environments in an interregional migration model in Great Britain.\\nIn a Poisson model , the predicted value of dependent variable for case i is modelled as the maximum-likelihood estimate of the mean of a Poisson-distributed variable Y i . This mean is logarithmically linked to a linear predictor by using a set of explanatory variables (Boyle & Flowerdew, 1993). The basic Poisson model used here is expressed as:\\nk ij ¼ exp b 0 þ b 1 ln P i ð Þ þ b 2 ln P j À Á þ b 3 ln d ij À Á þ b 4 X Â Ãð1Þ\\nwhere b are parameters to be estimated, k is the mean of the Poisson distribution (in this case, the migration from the location i to location j), P i and P j are the origin and destination populations, d ij is the distance between i and j and these three variables were logged. The remaining variables which were not logged are summarized by X. In addition to the gravity model variables, a contiguity variable was included which is a dummy variable distinguishing between those Provinces with and without a common boundary.\\nIn the next stage, social, economic and demographic variables were also added (referred to below as the socio-demographic model), and then the model was extended to include the environmental variables (referred to below as the environmental model). For each variable, the logged fit was also tested and the form of the variable with the most significant fit was introduced in the model. Variables were tested for multicollinearity. All variables with an adjusted R 2 larger than 0.8 in a multivariate regression of one independent variable against all the other independent variables were removed.\\nThe dependent variable was defined as the flows of migrants-i.e., the number of persons going through a migration.\\nThe goodness-of-fit of Poisson regression models can be evaluated using the deviance, which measures the variation in data that the model can not explain (for fuller explanations see Nelder & Wedderburn, 1972;Flowerdew, 1991). This is expressed as:\\nD ¼ 2Ry i ln y i =ŷ y i ð Þð2Þ\\nwhere y i is the observed value for the observation i and ŷ y i is the value estimated by the model. The lower the value of the deviance, the better the model fits and a v 2test can be performed to test whether the model deviance is an acceptable fit. The deviance value of the null model (the value when only a constant and no other explanatory variable is included in the model) provides a basis for comparison with other models. Thus, the power of each explanatory variable can be tested and compared.',\n",
       "  'Results': 'Table 4 provides the model deviances for a series of 11 models beginning with the simple gravity model and including each pair of origin-and destination-specific explanatory variables sequentially. The deviance was reduced by 52.1% with the simple gravity model variables, and by 73.3% using all the explanatory variables (the environmental model). the early 1980s. Since then, only a small number of migrants have been accepted in these areas. Places with higher proportions of men were less likely to lose migrants, while these places were attractive to in-migrants. Fig. 2 provides the 10 highest residual flows from the socio-demographic model, all of which were larger flows than expected. Four of these flows involved the sahelian Province of Yatenga, where the traditional Mossi political power was located. Two of these flows involved the Province of Kadiogo, which encompasses the capital of the country, Ouagadougou, emphasising the importance of urban-rural migration in this context. This suggests that additional explanatory variables related to socio-economic conditions in urban centers may improve the model fit.',\n",
       "  'Model with socio-demographic, climate and land degradation variables (environmental model)': \"The variable 'logged annual mean rainfall for 1983-84' was removed due to multicollinearity. Ten further variables were included in the environmental model, and  2). Differences between observed and predicted flows are indicated by thick lines for more than 1500 migrants, thin lines for 1000-1499 migrants, and dotted lines for less than 1000 migrants. the inclusion of these climate and land degradation variables reduced the deviance by a further 4.9%, to 73.3% (Table 4). Most of the parameters for the variables in the socio-demographic model remained in the same direction in this model (Table 5). However, the destination parameter for the male rate became negative when it was positive in the former model.\\nIn particular, we were interested in testing whether the environmental variables were significant, controlling for the socio-demographic variables. As expected, there were positive relationships between out-migration and both intra-and interannual rainfall variability (i.e. rainfall anomalies within the season and drought frequency), but the relationships were also positive at the destination, which is more surprising. It is probably rainfall variability in the regions of origin with a low rainfall that causes migration more than rainfall variability in the wetter regions of destination. In the latter, variability associated with a high annual rainfall does not constrain crop yields. Also, migration was negatively related to soil degradation at the destination and positively at the origin, as expected. Migration was negatively related to percentage of cultivated area at the origin, as expected, but it was also negatively associated with migration at the destination. Finally, migration flows were larger when cotton yields in 1984 were high at the destination and low at the origin, which again supports the idea that environmental variables do influence migration.\\nAmong the 870 flows, the 10 major contributors to the deviance are shown in Fig. 3. These ten flows were much larger than predicted by the model and were identical to the residuals for the socio-demographic model, expect for the flow from Houet to Kadiogo (the two Provinces with a large city).\",\n",
       "  'Models for specific origins': \"To better understand the causal relationship between environmental factors and migration, two further models were fitted. The first was restricted to flows from the two northernmost sahelian Provinces of Soum and Oudalan, where biophysical conditions are most marginal and human activities are especially sensitive to climatic variability. The second was restricted to flows from the two southern Provinces of Nahouri and Bougouriba where climatic conditions are much better. These two Provinces were selected because their total population approximates that of Soum and Oudalan. In both cases, the destinations included all the Provinces in the country. Other than the population variable (ln POPI), only variables relating to the destination were retained in these models. Each model therefore included 58 flows, with a total of 7022 out-migrants from the northern Provinces and 2777 from the southern Provinces.\\nThe analysis of the deviance clearly demonstrates that the flows from the southern Provinces were more influenced by socio-demographic variables (15.8% compared to 3.9% for biophysical variables, Table 6) than the flows from the drier northern Provinces which were more influenced by biophysical variables (16.3% with five biophysical variables compared to 4.4% with four socio-demographic variables).\\nThe most noticeable difference between the parameters of these models (Table 7) is that the flows from the northern Provinces were much more likely to be over short distances into Provinces with large populations (see the parameters for lnDISTIJ and lnPOPJ). They were also more likely to be into Provinces with the lowest level of soil degradation at destination. The soil degradation variable was not significant in the model describing migrations from southern Provinces. The flows from the north were also positively associated with yields for cotton in 1984 and negatively associated with intra-annual rainfall variability at destination, suggesting that the potential for cash crops and stable climatic conditions during the rainy season at the destination drives migration originating from the northern Provinces. By contrast, the migration flows from the two southern Provinces were mostly driven by high literacy rate at destination, which may reflect pull factors associated with urban influences. In both models, migration was negatively associated with the percentage of Provinces being under cultivation at the destination.  2). Differences between observed and predicted flows are indicated by thick lines for more than 1500 migrants, thin lines for 1000-1499 migrants, and dotted lines for less than 1000 migrants. constraints for agriculture; environmental variables improved the prediction of migration, even controlling for social, economic and demographic variables, but their contribution improved the fit less than the socio-demographic variables which accounted for about half the explanatory power. When only migration flows from the northern, ecologically marginal Provinces were taken into account, the environmental variables had a greater explanatory power than the socio-demographic variables (about four times the explanatory power). The direction of causal relationships between migration and environmental conditions at the origin and destination was generally consistent with the hypothesis that inter-provincial migrations in Burkina Faso are influenced by unfavourable conditions in rainfall variability, land degradation and land availability at the origin, and favourable conditions at the destination for these variables. Taking into account changes in the natural environment should allow Burkina Faso to better anticipate and plan for future migratory flows. Government can mostly intervene in the areas of land tenure, and social and economic infrastructures in Provinces of destination for migrants. In areas of origin, consciousness-raising campaigns on agricultural techniques to reduce vulnerability to drought and mitigate soil degradation can help to reduce out-migration. In Ouahigouya (a northern town of Burkina Faso, in Yatenga), such campaigns (refered to as '6S' for 'Se Servir de la Saison Se `che au Sahel': to use the dry season in the Sahel) have already reduced migration flows (personal communication from Ledia Ouedraogo, mayor of Ouahigouya). Recent claims that the Sahel is 'greening' after the end of the prolonged drought of the seventies and eighties (e.g., Rasmussen, Fog, & Madsen, 2001) could also mean that migration flows will be reduced in the years to come or even that return migrations could take place. If such trends would be confirmed, more investments should be made in Provinces that have contributed migrants in the past rather than in Provinces that have received migrants.\\nNote that interactions between migration, socio-economic factors and changes in the biophysical environment may be more complex than represented in the model. For example, while migration is influenced by environmental change at the origin, it may also contribute to this change at the destination (Lambin et al., 2001), although this is likely to be over a long time scale. Also, environmental change may have indirect effects on economic variables, such as price fluctuations, water access, foreign aid affecting local communities, etc. This was taken into account in part by removing independent variables which were strongly related to each other.\\nNevertheless, this study could be improved in a number of ways. First, the study relied upon census data that have their limitations, as the pastoral population in particular are not well recorded because of their seasonal movements (Randall, 1994). The Burkinabe census also lacked a post-census survey, which can be extremely useful in evaluating the comprehensiveness and quality of the data that have been collected. However, compared to other surveys, the census provides a large and relatively reliable source of data.\\nThe variable describing the severity of soil degradation (the GLASOD index) has been questioned by many authors, as it identifies a very high level of degradation in the central plateau of Burkina Faso (0 to 4 W, 11.5 to 13.5 N), while trends in rain-use efficiency only indicate moderate degradation (Prince, Brown de Colstoun, & Kravitz, 1998). Nicholson, Tucker and Ba (1998) argues that GLASOD indicators are ''largely extrapolated from risk factors in the environment'' (p. 818). Moreover, the spatial resolution of the GLASOD database is very coarse. This may explain why the severity of soil degradation had relatively little explanatory power in the migration model. Time-series remote sensing data will allow the estimation of land degradation at a much finer spatial resolution.\\nThe high level of spatial aggregation of the study (provincial level) might cause some ecological fallacies. This study is currently being repeated based on migration and socio-demographic data at the level of Departments for 1996. Land degradation data will be derived from time series remote sensing data for the nineties, which will be better synchronised with the migration data. An alternative approach is to consider migration at the individual or household level. Another extension of this study is looking at longitudinal survey data, collected at the individual level, allowing us to reconstruct individual migration trajectories. These personal biographies can be related to socio-economic time-varying variables at the level of the family, the community or the country, and to environmental variables.\\nDespite the above limitations, the results presented here clearly indicate that the relationship migration is influenced by biophysical changes in the environment, in addition of being influenced by distance, demographic and socio-economic variables. The prediction of migration flows should therefore be based on a larger spectrum of explanatory variables. This study, which quantified the relative importance of the environment on migration in Burkina Faso in the 1980s, does not support claims that environmental change alone is causing massive movements of socalled environmental refugees. Rather, the results show that it is the combination of socio-demographic factors and, to a lesser extent, environmental variables that explain inter-provincial migrations in Burkina Faso. Therefore, previous estimates on the importance of the phenomena of environmental refugees in West Africa appear to have been exaggerated.\",\n",
       "  'The gravity model': 'The gravity model had a relatively low explanatory power: 52.1%, compared to more than 70% in gravity models developed using European data (e.g. Boyle, Flowerdew, & Shen, 1998;Flowerdew & Aitkin, 1982). Thus, in Burkina Faso, this simple model is not sufficient to explain the inter-Provincial migrations. The model parameters (Table 5) showed that migration was positively related to both the origin and destination populations, and negatively related to the distance between the origin and destination, as we would expect.',\n",

The socio-demographic model reduced the deviance by 12.0% compared to the gravity model (model 2-Table 4), explaining 68.4% of the observed variation. All of the variables were significant (Table 5), and there were some interesting results. Migration was positively related to the literacy rate at both origin and destination, suggesting that migration was more likely to involve Provinces that had more educated populations. As expected, migration was positively related to the economic activity rates at both the origin and destination. Migration was negatively associated with the origin being an AVV area but, perhaps surprisingly, it was also negatively related to the destination being an AVV area. The AVV programme attracted a large number of migrants up until the completion of the programme in Thus, migrants are always attracted by land availability. All these results are consistent with expectations.\",\n",

       "  'INTRODUCTION': \"The impact of environmental factors on spatial mobility is a recurrent theme in the literature on migration in Burkina Faso and in other Sahelian countries. Repeated droughts and low soil productivity have often been cited as major factors pushing people to leave their villages (Boutillier, Quesnel, & Vaugelade, 1977;Cordell, Gregory, & Piche ´, 1996;Marchal, Please address correspondence to Sabine Henry, Department of Demography, Universite de Montre ´al, C.P. 6128, Succursale Centre-ville, Montre ´al, Que ´bec, Canada H3C 3J7; e-mail: sabine.henry@umontreal.ca 1975; Mathieu, 1994). The concept of environmental refugees is another illustration of the widespread belief that migration is strongly influenced by environmental conditions (Lonergan, 1998). Since rain-fed agriculture is the main source of livelihood in rural Burkina Faso, intuitively it makes sense that environmental factors (e.g. rainfall and land degradation) will influence socio-economic conditions and may lead people to emigrate. For example, in Sahelian and Sudanian regions, crop yields are mostly controlled by the amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season and we may expect that poor harvests tend to drive some households to migrate further south (Grouzis & Albergel, 1989;Sicot, 1989). A link between environmental conditions and migration was indeed measured in several settings in rural Africa (Ethiopia, see Ezra, 2001;Mali, see Findley, 1994). Yet, despite repeated statements on the effects of environmental factors on migration in Burkina Faso, there is little empirical evidence on this topic. Lack of appropriate data is an important factor in explaining this situation. Compared to data on mortality and fertility, data on migration are scarce in most African countries. The most detailed study of burkinabe migration relies on the 1974-1975 National Migration Survey (Cordell et al., 1996), almost 30 years old. A national survey on migration and urbanisation was also conducted in 1992 (Re ´publique du Burkina Faso and CERPOD, 1997), but the data are considered unreliable and have hardly been used. Finally, censuses also offer some information on spatial mobility in Burkina Faso, but they are highly aggregated and only give information at the time of the census. Environmental data are also in very short supply, and rainfall time-series are in fact the only reliable data on environmental conditions covering a long period for the entire country.\\nThe aim of this study is to explore the impact of rainfall conditions on the first departure from the village in Burkina Faso. This study combines recent longitudinal multilevel data from a national retrospective migration survey, a large-scale retrospective community survey and a long time-series of rainfall data. This study more specifically focuses on the influence of agro-climatic factors on the risk of ''leaving the village'', among both men and women. Individual-level variables and community-level factors are combined with rainfall data in discrete-time event-history analyses to model the determinants of first migration from rural areas over the last 30 years. Competing risk analyses are performed to explore the differential effects of rainfall conditions depending on the destination and the duration of migrations.\\nThe first part of the study summarises the background. Methodology, data sources and explanatory variables are presented in the second part. In the third part we present the descriptive and multivariate results. The paper ends with the discussion of the results and the conclusion.\",\n",
       "  'BACKGROUND': '',\n",
       "  'General Background': \"Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world: it ranked 159th of 162 countries in the UNDP's human development index (UNDP, 2001), and its GDP per capita was approximately 230 US$ at the end of the 1990s (IMF, 2000). The country's population was estimated at 10.3 million in the last census (1996), growing at a rate of about 2.7% per year. With an urbanisation rate close to 20%, it is one of the least urbanised countries in the world (PRB, 2001). The country's economy depends heavily on agriculture and cattle-raising: together they account for one-third of the country's GDP and 90% of the population is engaged in these activities (INSD, 2000). Agriculture in Burkina Faso is to a large extent a rain-fed subsistence agriculture, and its productivity is mainly determined by environmental factors (Niemeijer & Mazzucato, 2002). As a consequence, the agro-climatic conditions are critical to rural households, for which agriculture represents the main source of livelihood.\",\n",
       "  'Environmental Conditions in Burkina Faso': \"Burkina Faso is a Sahelian country characterised by a strong southnorth decreasing gradient of average annual rainfall (Figure 1). In the northern part of Burkina Faso, the rainfall is scarce and irregular, with an average annual precipitation below 500 mm. The agro-climatic conditions are thus very constraining for agriculture and the main economic activities are extensive pastoralism and rain-fed agriculture of pearl millet and sorghum (Hampshire & Randall, 1999). The conditions are more suitable for agriculture in the southern part (average rainfall above 900 mm), where the main crops include maize and cotton in addition to millet and sorghum (Ingram, Roncoli, & Kirshen, 2002).\\nThe country's rainfall is also characterised by a high degree of seasonal and annual variability (Roncoli, Ingram, & Kirshen, 2001). Rain falls during a single wet season lasting three to five months (approximately from May to September). Large year-to-year variations in total precipitation and in the timing of rainfalls translate into extremely variable crop outcome and uncertainty at the household level (Reardon, Matlon, & Delgado, 1988;Roncoli et al., 2001). Following the general pattern of Sahelian West Africa, Burkina Faso has experienced a long-term downward trend of rainfall over the last 50 years (Nicholson, 2001;Niemeijer & Mazzucato, 2002). The long period of aridity that began in the late 1960s was accompanied by several droughts, most notably those in the early 1970s and in the mid-1980s (Hampshire and Randall, 1999;Nicholson, 2001;Roncoli et al., 2001).\\nBurkina Faso is also characterised by poor soil fertility and, according to various authors, land degradation is a serious problem in this part of Africa (Lindqvist & Tengberg, 1993). The issue of land degradation in Burkina Faso is controversial, however. On the basis of an assessment by FIGURE 1. Map of Burkina Faso showing mean annual rainfall at the department level, 1960-98.\\nregional experts (GLASOD map in Oldeman, Hakkeling & Sombroeck, 1990), a large part of the country (mostly the Mossi Plateau) is considered degraded. Empirical data on land degradation are sparse however, and a recent study suggested that neither the agricultural soil productivity nor the soil chemical fertility had significantly declined over the last few decades in Burkina Faso (Niemeijer & Mazzucato, 2002). So, while soils are poor in most parts of the country, there is no convincing evidence of a widespread degradation trend. Other factors seriously constrain agricultural productivity however. The lack of fertilisers, the low degree of mechanisation of agriculture, the lack of irrigation, and the spread of parasitic plants all act as constraints on agriculture (Berner et al., 1997;Ingram et al., 2002).\",\n",
       "  'Migration in Burkina Faso': \"Burkina Faso has long been characterised by intense mobility, both within the country and to other countries such as Co ˆte d'Ivoire and Ghana (Cordell et al., 1996;Hampshire & Randall, 1999). Migrations to neighbouring countries represent a large proportion of all migrations from rural areas (the majority of migrations among men), and Co ˆte d'Ivoire has long been the principal destination for international migrants, attracting approximately 80% of these in the 1990s. 1 Labour migration to Co ˆte d'Ivoire can be traced to historical factors such as forced labour policies and colonial taxation under French colonial rule (Cordell et al., 1996). Co ˆte d'Ivoire has continued until recently to attract a large number of Burkinabe migrants, mainly composed of young men moving for economic reasons (Cordell et al., 1996;Roncoli et al., 2001), although the situation is likely to change with the recent conflict in Co ˆte d'Ivoire. Migrations from rural areas have also been directed towards urban centres and have contributed significantly to the process of urbanisation since the post-war years (Cordell et al., 1996). Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso's two largest urban centres, have attracted the largest share of rural-urban movers over the last decades, although smaller towns have also received important numbers of migrants (INSD, 2000).\\nMigrations within rural areas are still the dominant type of internal migration flow and involve both short-distance and long-distance moves. The former disproportionately concern women migrating for family reasons, such as marriage and separation, while long-distance moves mainly consist of migrations for economic reasons, such as agricultural expansion. One specific type of long-distance move in rural Burkina Faso developed from the late 1960s and involves migrations from densely populated areas in the Mossi Plateau to the less populated areas of Burkina Faso's southwest (Cordell et al., 1996;Goldberg & Frongillo, 2001). Migrations between rural areas were also encouraged by resettlement programmes, such as the AVV (Ame ´nagement des Valle ´es des Voltas) programme launched in the early 1970s to develop regions freed from onchorcercosis, also called river blindness disease (Cordell, et al., 1996;Oue ´draogo, 1986). Spontaneous population movements also swelled in the villages adjacent to the official migration areas (Quesnel, 1999).\\nAs in other developing countries, circulation is also a prominent feature of burkinabe migration (Blion, 1995;Cordell et al., 1996). In other words, people continue to maintain strong links with their place of origin, and a large fraction of migrants tend to return to their village at some point. In Burkina Faso, the probability of returning to the village is especially high among men: 60% of those leaving their village after age 15 return within 10 years, while the corresponding figure for women is around 15% (Schoumaker et al., 2002). Those leaving the country also have the highest probability of returning to their village, 2 but a significant percentage of those leaving to urban and (to a lesser extent) rural destinations also go back to their village (Schoumaker et al., 2002). The fact that a considerable proportion of those leaving their village tend to return home at some point suggests that one should also look at the factors that influence the risk of returning to the village. That question will be addressed in further research. However, by distinguishing short-term and long-term migrations, this study will partly take into account the fact that a significant fraction of those leaving actually return to their village of origin.\",\n",
       "  'Environmental Conditions and Migration': \"The role of environmental factors in explaining migration is a persistent theme in the literature (Boutillier et al., 1977;Cordell et al., 1996;Marchal, 1975;Mathieu, 1994). As far as climatic conditions are concerned, the common view is that ''migration rises both immediately and as a long-term response to the threat of recurrent droughts'' (Findley, 1994, p. 539). Quite illustrative in this respect is the anecdote reported in the preface of Hoe and Wage, a detailed study of migration in Burkina Faso.\\nIn October 1974, in the village of Nanou in Southwestern Burkina Faso, Siaka Coulibaly, the chief, extended the traditional welcome. [...] Introductions made and visitors welcomed, he spoke: ''You want to know why people migrate? Well, make it pour money and bring rain in abundance. Then you will know why people leave.'' (Cordell et al., 1996, p. xii).\\nBecause rain-fed agriculture is the main source of livelihood in rural Burkina Faso, it is natural to expect some impact of rainfall on migration. Migratory responses to climatic constraints can take several forms however: some people will move for a short duration and return to their village within a few months (temporary migration). Others will leave their region permanently to cultivate in better endowed rural areas or to work in urban areas or abroad.\\nTemporary migration is an important aspect of spatial mobility in the drought-affected Sahel and is often interpreted as part of a household survival strategy for coping with drought and high levels of production uncertainty (Guilmoto, 1998;Hampshire & Randall, 1999;Hill, 1990;Reardon et al., 1988;Roncoli et al., 2001). Such temporary moves usually involve only a few members of the household (mainly young men) and represent a way to diversify incomes. While temporary migration may be adopted as a strategy even in non-drought years (Ezra, 2001;Hampshire & Randall, 1999;Reardon et al., 1988), it is likely to vary with fluctuations in rainfall and harvests (Findley, 1994). Young men may be more likely to move in periods of economic hardship to earn additional incomes, whether in rural areas, in urban areas or abroad (Coulibaly & Vaugelade, 1981;Lallemand, 1975;Roncoli et al., 2001). Migration can also be used to reduce the number of consumers by sending children and women to stay with relatives in a period of drought (Findley, 1994;Roncoli et al., 2001). Finally, fluctuations in rainfall may also influence the destination of migration. Since moving abroad or to urban areas usually entails higher costs than moving to rural areas, such moves may be postponed in periods of economic stress (Findley, 1994;Nelson, 1983).\\nSome people may also leave their village permanently in response to the risk of repeated droughts (Findley, 1994). Cordell et al. (1996) suggest, for example, that migrations from the northwestern part of the Mossi Plateau in the late 1960s-early 1970s were induced by irregular rainfall, and that migrants departed for areas with more rainfall (see also Boutillier et al., 1977). Permanent migrations may also be influenced by rainfall-driven fluctuations in harvests. For example, migrants may decide to move after several consecutive years of bad harvests. Female migration could also increase after poor harvests, as women might be permitted or encouraged to marry earlier in order to reduce the family's food demands (Findley, 1994). On the other hand, long-term migrations to urban areas and to foreign countries might be deterred in years following bad harvests, as discussed for the case of temporary migrations.\\nIn summary, long-term rainfall conditions as well as short-term variations of rainfall are likely to influence both temporary and permanent migrations. Although poor rainfall conditions are often believed to increase the risk of moving, the effects of rainfall may differ depending on the destination and the duration of migration. Gender differences are also expected as the motives of migration vary greatly by gender: males generally move for economic reasons whereas women's moves depend essentially on family reasons. As a result, male migration should be more sensitive to rainfall conditions, even though female migration may also be expected to rise in some circumstances (Table 1).\\nThe decrease in soil productivity is also generally considered to be a determinant of migration in Burkina Faso. However, due to the lack of reliable data, this question is not addressed in this study. Two land degradation variables were included in preliminary analyses: a land degradation assessment obtained from the GLASOD map (Oldeman Hakkeling, & Sumbroek, 1990), and a land degradation indicator based on the rain-use efficiency index obtained by combining satellite data and rainfall data (Prince, Brown De Colstoun , & Kravitz, 1998). Neither of these indicators was retained in the models because of their low reliability (GLASOD) or the very small proportion of areas considered as degraded (rain-use efficiency index).\",\n",
       "  'METHOD AND DATA': 'This study focuses on the determinants of village departure after age 15, using multilevel longitudinal data and event history methods. Analyses are restricted to the first out-migration from the village after age 15, retained as the age at which participation in decision making is considered to commence (INSTRAW, 1994). The decision to focus on the determinants of the first departure from the village is justified by the fact that it represents a significant life event. Moreover, because a significant fraction of migrants return to their village, taking into account the subsequent migrations would tend to dilute the effects of environmental factors on migration. Analyses are performed separately for men and women, as we expect the effect of rainfall conditions to differ by gender. Finally, because the effects of rainfall conditions on the risk of leaving may also vary according to the destination and the duration of migration, competing risk models are used in addition to models that treat all the events the same.\\nAs suggested by various authors, it is desirable to include factors at the community and individual/household levels to investigate the determinants of migration (Bilsborrow, 1984;Findley, 1987;Lucas, 1997). Migration behaviours depend strongly on individual and household characteristics such as age, education, economic activity and household socio-economic status (Lucas, 1997;Hugo, 1998). In addition, the characteristics of the place of residence are also likely to play a major role in the migration decision-making process (Gardner, 1981;Hugo, 1985). Place-related factors provide opportunities and constraints that make an area more or less attractive to an individual (availability of land, local labour market conditions, etc.), and factors such as its accessibility may also act as facilitators of migration or influence the awareness of potential destinations (Oberai & Bilsborrow, 1984). Environmental conditions are considered as one specific type of contextual characteristics that may influence migration decisions. In this study, both individual factors and contextual factors are included in the models. Although household-level factors may also be important determinants of migration (Hugo, 1998), few time-varying household-level variables were collected in the survey, and none was retained in this study. Actually, the relevant variables at the household level (such as the position of the migrant in the household or the agricultural practice at the household level) were not time-varying. We think that the definition of these household variables is too restricted to be relevant in this migration analysis.\\nA longitudinal approach was taken to study the determinants of migration. People are likely to migrate in response to changing individual or contextual conditions, and longitudinal data and methods are well-suited to incorporate such factors in migration models. This approach thus not only requires individual longitudinal data on migration (a migration history), but also community-level and environmental data about the places of residence in which the sampled individuals lived in the past, at every point in time. The data are presented below.',\n",
       "  'Data': \"This study uses data from three sources. The individual life history data come from the nationally-representative retrospective survey on migration, 3 conducted in 2000 by the UERD at the University of Ouagadougou, the Demography Department of the University of Montreal and the CERPOD in Bamako (Poirier et al., 2001). The full sample comprises 8644 individuals (men and women) aged 15-64 at the time of the survey. The questionnaire covered several topics such as migration, employment, marital and fertility histories. For each sampled individual, a complete migration history from the age of six was collected. Information on every spell of residence that lasted more than 3 months was recorded: the date of arrival, the name of the village (rural areas) or neighbourhood (urban areas), the motive for leaving the place of residence, etc. A similar approach was adopted for the employment history. This study uses data from both the migration history and the employment history.\\nThe community-level data come from a retrospective community survey conducted of 600 settlements in early 2002. The survey was designed to be linked with the individual migration survey. It comprises all the villages in which people lived at the time of the survey and a large sample of villages in which they lived in the past. Each village for which at least three spells of residence were reported in the migration histories was covered by the survey (600 villages of a total of 1800 villages in which at least one spell of residence was reported). Retrospective data was collected from groups of community informants, consisting of ''de ´le ´gue ´s de village'' (administrative representatives), village chiefs and other knowledgeable informants. It covered a broad range of topics, including land availability, transportation, agriculture, and employment opportunities. Efforts were made to obtain retrospective information since 1960 on most village characteristics. For example, informants were asked to recall all the years in which harvests were ''particularly bad'', the year since which uncleared land was no longer available, etc. A village calendar, including national events and events directly linked to the life in the village (such as the construction of a school) was used to improve the quality of dates. The interview of several informants together, as it was done in this survey, is also believed to improve the quality of the data (Axinn, Barber, & Ghimire, 1997;Frankenberg, 2000). In addition, a detailed study of the quality of data was performed by comparing the statements of interviewees to external databases (Schoumaker et al., 2004).\\nAs mentioned above, community-level data was only collected for a sample of settlements. Community-level variables are missing for 12.2% of the residence spells among the 3911 individuals in the analysis sample (5.6% of the 145,000 person-periods). Random hot-deck imputation supplied the missing values at the village level. The imputation is based on two classification variables: the province (45 provinces) in which the village is located and the size of the village (less than 5000 or between 5000 and 10,000 inhabitants). Adjustment cells were formed by combining these two variables, and the missing values for a village were replaced by the values from a randomly selected village in the same cell, that is a village of the same size located in the same province. Multiple imputation was performed to incorporate uncertainty due to missing community-level data (Allison, 2002).\\nRainfall data covering the 1960-1998 period were obtained from the global monthly precipitation data set produced by the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (New, Hulme, & Jones, 2000). These data were interpolated from a network of stations at a spatial resolution of 0.5°latitude and longitude. Monthly rainfall data were extracted from this database and two rainfall variables were constructed at the department level using geographical information systems (GIS). 4\",\n",
       "  'Analysis Sample and Statistical Model': \"The analysis sample is restricted to people living in rural areas at age 15, 5 and covers the 1970-1998 period. Migration is defined here as a change of residence involving a departure from the village for a duration of at least three months. Each individual is ''followed'' from age 15 until his or her first migration or until the time of censoring. 6 The data are organised as a person-period data file in which each line represents a 3-month period, and the dependant variable indicates if a migration occurs during each threemonth interval. 7 Overall, the sample consists of 3911 individuals (1800 men and 2111 women), and a total of approximately 145,000 person-periods.\\nBinary and multinomial logistic regression methods are used to estimate discrete-time event history models (Allison, 1995). Models that do not distinguish among the event types are fitted with binary logistic regression. The statistical model is specified as follows:\\nlog p ti 1 À p ti ¼ a t þ b 0 :X tið1Þ\\nwhere p ti is the conditional probability that individual i experiences the event (first migration) at age t, given that the event has not already occurred.\\na rt represents the baseline hazard function, and X ti is a vector of individual, contextual and environmental covariates. Both time-constant and timevarying covariates are included in the models. Multinomial logistic regression is used for competing risk analyses that distinguish among the destinations and/or types of migration. The discretetime competing risk model assumes that the log-odds of experiencing an event of type r rather than an event of type s (the reference category) at time t are given by log\\np rti p sti ¼ a rt þ b 0 r :X rtið2Þ\\nwhere p rti is the conditional probability of an event of type r occurring at time t for individual i, given that no event has occurred prior to time t. a rt represents the baseline hazard function for an event of type r, and X rti is a vector of covariates. Censored cases (no migration) are treated as the reference category, and the destinations (rural, urban and abroad) and/or types of migration (temporary or permanent) are distinguished as separate events. All of the models take into account the fact that the data are clustered, and the standard errors of the regression coefficients are adjusted accordingly using Huber-White standard errors (Hox, 2002). Multiple imputation was also performed to correct for the underestimation of standard errors due to missing community-level data (Allison, 2002).\",\n",
       "  'EXPLANATORY VARIABLES': 'Table 2 presents the explanatory variables as well as the proportion of respondents in each category at age 15. The individual-level, communitylevel and environmental variables included in the models are discussed below. The two migration models, among men and women, include the same explanatory variables (with identical categories). Although the number of cases may be small for some categories of the explanatory variables, particularly for women, this approach has been preferred to ensure the comparability of the models across gender.',\n",
       "  'Individual Variables': 'Numerous studies from both developed and developing countries have shown that age is strongly linked to the risk of migration. In this sample, the risk of first migration among men increases with age for a few years after age 15 and then declines (Figure 2). Among females, the risk of first migration decreases sharply with age. The non-linear relationships between age and the risk of migration are modelled here by a function of age and its logarithm. These two measures form the baseline hazard of first migration. 8 The positive relationship between education and migration is also one of the most consistent findings of migration studies, especially for migrations to urban areas (Lututala, 1995;Todaro, 1997). Education is measured by a time-constant variable indicating the level attained by the individual at the age of 15 9 . Differential propensities to migrate among ethnic groups have also been shown in various studies in Burkina Faso; in particular the Mossi and the Fulani are distinguished from other ethnic groups. The Mossi, the majority ethnic group in Burkina Faso, constitute 45% of the analysis sample. Mossi people live mainly on the densely populated Central Plateau (the Mossi Plateau), but are also known for their migrations to southwestern regions (Marchal, 1975;Mathieu, 1994). The Fulani (10% of the sample) live essentially in the northern and eastern parts of the country, and are also a highly mobile population (Hampshire and Randall, 1999). Although the Fulani used to be nomadic people specialised in cattle-raising, many of  them settled under the influence of the colonial power and the independent State (Copans, 1975). They are still dominant in cattle-raising activities however: 57% of the men engaged in cattle-raising at age 15 are Fulani. The third category assembles 10 ethnic groups, among which the Senoufo (14%), the Gourmantche (8%) and the Gourounsi (7%) are the most represented.\\nFinally, a time-varying variable indicates the principal activity performed by the individual at each point in time. Three categories are compared in the models. Cultivators represent the large majority of the sample (79% of the population at age 15). A little more than 4% of the respondents declared that they were cattle-raisers, and 17% of the sample is engaged in other types of activities, mainly craft and petty trade of food (students account for 3% of the total).',\n",
       "  'Rainfall Variables': \"Two variables measured at the department level are used to capture two dimensions of the potential impacts of rainfall on migration: the mean annual precipitation over the 1960-1998 period and the percent of normal precipitation over the three preceding years. 10 Besides their simplicity, the two indicators used in this study were selected on an empirical basis. Several rainfall indicators were tested to predict the occurrence of poor harvests reported in the community survey, and the two indicators retained were the only significant predictors of the poor harvests.\\nPeople living in regions with a higher vulnerability to drought are expected to be more likely to leave their villages -temporarily or permanently -than those living in regions with more rainfall. The first variable (mean annual precipitation) is considered a good indicator of agricultural productivity and of vulnerability to drought. Four categories are compared: less than 500 mm per year, 500 to 699 mm per year, 700 to 899 mm per year, and more than 900 mm per year (Figure 6). These categories correspond to areas where crops with similar yield responses to water are cultivated (Doorenbos & Kassam, 1987). In addition, we tried to have a sufficient number of observations in each category.\\nOverall, it is also expected that the risk of first migration will increase if the preceding years were unfavourable, although unfavourable conditions could also have an opposite effect if people postpone migrations in periods of economic stress (Findley, 1992;Nelson, 1983). The second variable is a time-varying variable indicating the extent to which rainfall in the department over the three preceding years differed from the long-term rainfall conditions in the department. The measure is the ratio of the mean rainfall over the three preceding years to the mean rainfall over the 1960-1998 period, and three categories 11 are compared in the models (less than 85%, 85 -94%, and more than 95%). Several time windows (1, 2, and 3 years) were tested and the three-year window was selected for several reasons. First, rural households may have sufficient stocks of cereals or enough money, livestock and assets to purchase cereals following a poor harvest (Lallemand, 1975;Reardon et al., 1988). In other words, people may be able to cope with one poor harvest without resorting to migration. They are more likely to have depleted their assets after two or three consecutive bad harvests however, a situation that could force them into migration. Moreover, several consecutive years of poor precipitation may also increase people's perception of worsening rainfall conditions and affect their decision to move to better watered regions. A longer time window would dilute the relevance of this time-varying factor.\",\n",
       "  'Community-level Variables': \"Three community-level variables are included to capture the effects of opportunities and constraints at the village level that may influence migration behaviour. The first community-level variable is a time-varying binary variable indicating, for each year, if uncleared land was still available in the village. 12 The common hypothesis is that out-migration tends to be more pronounced from areas where land is no longer available or no longer sufficient to maintain people's levels of livelihood (Hugo, 1985;Tallet, 1985). In Burkina Faso, the Mossi Plateau is very densely populated compared to the eastern and southern parts of the country, and some authors have suggested that migrations from the Mossi Plateau may be induced by the lack of land (Tallet, 1985). 13  The second time-varying community-level variable indicates if the village is connected by an all-season road. Transportation networks can have complex impacts on the risks of migration (Bilsborrow, 1984). The usual assumption is that higher accessibility increases the risk of migration, especially short-term migration (Findley, 1987). However, access to roads may also contribute to reducing out-migration by creating opportunities for income diversification (Reardon et al., 1988) or by facilitating food aid distribution in periods of drought (Coulibaly & Vaugelade, 1981).\\nThe third time-varying community-level variable indicates whether or not contour stone walls (diguettes) are used in the village. 14 This soil and water conservation technique not only reduces erosion but also improves the availability of water for cultivation by encouraging infiltration (Bandre & Batta, 1998). Such techniques have been shown to significantly improve cereal yields in Burkina Faso (Bandre & Batta, 1998), and are expected to reduce out-migration.\",\n",
       "  'RESULTS': '',\n",
       "  'Descriptive Results': \"Figure 2 compares the risk of leaving the village for the first time after the age of 15 for men and women, and Figure 3 shows the corresponding survival curves, that is the probabilities of still being in the village by age. Before the age of 18, women's risks of leaving the village are significantly higher than men's risks, but are two to three times lower after that age. The survival curves cross at around 21, and the probability of remaining in the village is eventually much higher for women (50%) than for men (35%). These gender differences are probably largely explained by marriage migrations. Women's marriages are concentrated in a narrow age range and are often accompanied by a migration to the husband's place of residence, which means that a large proportion of women will migrate for the first time after age 15 at the time of their marriage (see below). Women's migrations for marriages before the age of 15 may also explain why, overall, a lower percentage of women leave their village after the age of 15.\\nTable 3 gives some characteristics of first migrations. Gender differences are even more patent for these characteristics than for the timing of first migration. While almost two-thirds of males's first migrations are directed to a foreign country, only 15% of their female counterparts engage in such migrations. On the other hand, 70% of women's first migrations are directed to another village, whereas this concerns only 23% of men's first migrations. Urban areas represent 14% of the destinations of first migration among both men and women. As seen in Table 3, motives for first migration also vary strongly according to gender. Almost 80% of women move for family reasons (65% for marriage), and only a low 14% for economic motives. A completely opposite pattern emerges among men, where economic reasons are reported for two-thirds of migrations. Finally, Table 3 also shows that 83% of those leaving do not return to their village within 2 years, indicating that short-term migrations are not the dominant type of move. Strong gender differences are observed however: while only 5% of women go back to their village within two years of departure, almost one-third of their male counterparts are involved in short-term migrations. Migrants to foreign countries are also much more likely to return to their village within 2 years than those moving to urban and rural areas.\",\n",
       "  'Multivariate Results: All Destinations Combined': 'The main hypothesis is that individuals who live in areas with unfavorable rainfall conditions -including long-term conditions and short-term fluctuations -are expected to have a higher risk of leaving their village than those who live in areas with more favorable rainfall conditions. We first look at the factors influencing the risk of the first departure from the village, treating all migration types the same. All of the models are fitted separately for males and females (Table 4). The first model includes the individual-level variables and the rainfall variables (models 1a and 1b); the community-level variables are added in the second series of models (models 2a and 2b).\\nIndividual-level variables. Models 1a and 1b (Table 4) show that, as expected, the risk of leaving the village for the first time is higher among educated people (2.41 *** ). Among men, the risk of moving is significantly higher only for those who have had some secondary schooling (2.04 *** ). The effect of primary education is more pronounced among women, while there is no difference between those who reached primary school and the few women that went to secondary school. The type of activity (timevarying variable) is also strongly related to the risk of moving. The odds of leaving the village are twice higher among people engaged in non-agricultural activities (2.06 *** ). The risk of leaving the village is higher among women engaged in cattle-raising (2.78 *** , only a few women). On the other hand, males engaged in cattle-raising (0.92) are slightly (but not significantly) less likely to move than those involved in agriculture (reference). The higher propensity to migrate among the Mossi (reference) is in line with the literature on the specificity of Mossi migration. Rainfall and community-level variables. Models 1a and 1b (Table 4) also include the two rainfall variables. Contrary to our expectation, results show that men living in poor agro-climatic regions tend to have slightly lower risks (0.92) of moving than those in areas with greater rainfall (reference), but the relationship is not statistically significant. Among women, there is no relationship between the agro-climatic region and the risk of leaving the village. Unexpectedly, results for the second rainfall variable suggest that, for both men and women, the risk of moving is in fact slightly higher if the previous years were favourable (reference) than if they were unfavourable (0.88). However, these results are not statistically significant either. The effects of the individual-level and rainfall variables do not change notably with the inclusion of community-level variables (models 2a and 2b, Table 4). As expected, the presence of an all-season road increases the overall risk of moving (1.50 *** ), and is the only statistically significant community-level variable. However, people living in villages where uncleared land is still available do not have a lower risk of leaving the village. Finally, there is no significant effect of the use of a water conservation technique on the risk of moving.',\n",
       "  'Multivariate Results: Distinction Between Destinations': 'As discussed before, there are reasons to expect that the effects of explanatory variables -notably environmental variables -may differ across destinations. Three types of destinations (rural areas, urban areas and abroad) are distinguished with competing risk models. Results are reported in Table 5 (models 3a and 3b). The results are presented in three separate columns, each column pertaining to the contrast between a single destination and no migration (reference).',\n",
       "  'Individual level variables. The effects of the individual-level vari-': \"ables vary strongly depending on the destination. The relationship between education and the risk of moving for the first time to urban areas is very strong and positive (5.82 *** ), but is weak and non-significant towards rural areas (1.88) and rather negative for migrations to a foreign country (0.56). The fact that educated people are more likely to move to urban areas than the uneducated is thus clearly confirmed in Burkina Faso. The link between ethnic group and the risk of leaving the village for the first time also varies strongly by destination. While the Mossi are overall more likely to leave their village when no distinction is made between destinations, Fulani males have the highest propensity to leave their village for another village (rural-rural migration, 1.67). This is not observed among females however,  where the risk of moving to another village among the Fulani (0.49 *** ) is only half the risk of the Mossi. 15 The Mossi, both men and women, have a much higher propensity to move to urban areas than the other ethnic groups, and Mossi males are also significantly more likely to leave for Co ˆte d'Ivoire, confirming a known characteristic of foreign migration from Burkina Faso (Blion, 1995;Cordell et al., 1996;Deniel, 1967).\\nThe effect of the type of activity on the risk of moving for the first time also differs across destinations and gender. Regardless of gender, individuals involved in cattle-raising are more likely to move to rural areas than those involved in agriculture. On the other hand, males involved in cattle-raising are less likely to move to urban areas. As far as temporary moves are concerned, this could be explained by the year-round commitment required: cattle-raisers cannot easily leave their herds just for a few months (Hampshire & Randall, 1999). No explanation was found for the higher risk of moving abroad among females involved in cattle-raising, but only a few women are involved in such activities. Finally, people involved in activities other than agriculture or cattle-raising are overall much more likely to leave their village.\\nRainfall variables. The relationships between rainfall variables and the risk of leaving the village for the first time also vary significantly across destinations. The link between average rainfall conditions and migration is especially clear in rural areas. As expected, the odds of leaving the village for another village are three times higher for men living in the poorest agroclimatic region (3.16 ** ) than for those living in areas with an average rainfall over 900 mm (reference) (Table 5). Even though the relationship is less pronounced for women, those living in wetter areas (reference) are also less likely to move to another rural destination than women living in the drier regions (2.52 *** ). The relationship between the average rainfall and the risk of migrating to urban areas is much less consistent. There is however a significant relationship between the agro-climatic conditions and the risk of leaving for a foreign country, among both males and females. Results indicate that those living in the wetter areas (reference) are in fact much more likely to leave their village for a foreign country (0.61). Although it may seem surprising, this result is not completely unexpected. First, this could partly be interpreted as a proximity effect, since the wetter regions are located near Co ˆte d'Ivoire. However, migrations to Co ˆte d'Ivoire are generally directed to the more remote areas in the forest zone, and this suggests that factors other than distance are at play. One tentative explanation is that people from the wetter regions of Burkina Faso must necessarily go further south (out of Burkina Faso) to find better watered areas.\\nRainfall conditions in the three preceding years are also significantly related to the propensity for leaving the village for the first time. As expected, the risk of moving to rural areas is significantly higher among males if there was a rainfall deficit over the three preceding years (1.58 * ). The odds of leaving are 60% higher if the conditions were unfavourable (less than 85% of the long-term average) than if they were normal (more than 95%). This result thus suggests that not only average rainfall but also short-term unfavourable rainfall conditions tend to push men to leave for other rural areas. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no significant effect of recent rainfall conditions on the risk of leaving among females, and they seem rather less likely to leave their village in years following poor rainfall conditions. An interesting result is the opposite pattern that emerges for migrations to urban areas and foreign countries. Overall, people are more likely to migrate to these destinations if the recent rainfall conditions were favourable. Both men and women seem to be more likely to move to urban areas in normal conditions than in unfavourable periods (0.62 for men, 0.37 + for women), although results are not significant. Among men, the odds of moving to a foreign country are also approximately 50% higher in normal periods than in unfavorable periods (0.69 ** ). One tentative explanation might be that rural people are waiting for good economic conditions in the preceding years before moving to urban areas and to foreign countries (Findley, 1994;Nelson, 1983), as they may need a production surplus to finance their migration.\\nCommunity-level effects. Two of the three community-level variables are significantly related to the risk of leaving the village for the first time (Table 5). First, as expected, people living in villages connected by an all-season road are more likely to migrate to rural and urban areas than those living in places without roads. The effect is particularly strong on the risk of moving to urban areas, with odds of moving more than three times higher in places accessible by road. This agrees with results from studies in other settings (Findley, 1987). Contrary to our expectation however, there is no significant relationship between the availability of uncleared land and the risk of moving. This somewhat surprising result thus suggests that the link between land availability and migration is weak, or that a more refined analysis is needed. One tentative explanation might that agricultural intensification in more densely populated places may offset the expected effect of land availability on migration. Finally, men living in places where soil and water conservation techniques are used are somewhat less likely to migrate to rural and urban areas (not significant), while they are significantly more likely to move abroad. As discussed before, the slight negative effect in rural and urban areas could be explained by the fact that these techniques improve cereal yields and as a result may decrease the need for migration. 16  However, no explanation was found at this stage for the fact that people living in places where water conservation techniques are used are more likely to move to foreign countries.\",\n",
       "  'Multivariate Results: Distinction Between Short-term and Long-term Migrations': 'While the previous results identify some effects of environmental conditions on the risk of leaving the village, they do not indicate whether people leave their village permanently or for a short period. In this section, we further refine the dependant variable to distinguish between short-term and long-term migrations. Six types of migrations -classified according to destination and duration -are now considered. A short-term migration is defined here as a change of residence involving a departure from the village for a duration of between 3 months and 2 years. 17 As discussed before, short-term migrations represent 17% of first migrations, but that proportion varies strongly by gender and destination (Table 3). Males are much more likely to engage in short-term migration (31%), and international migrants are also much more likely to return to their village within 2 years (36%). Multivariate results are presented in Tables 6 (males) and 7 (females).\\nInteresting patterns emerge for individual and community-level variables. For example, more educated men are significantly more likely to engage in long-term moves than uneducated people, and are much less likely to move for a short duration. Among males, the presence of an all-season road in the village has a stronger effect on the risk of undertaking a short-term rural-urban migration than on the risk of a long-term move. For the purpose of this paper, however, we will concentrate on the effects of the rainfall variables.\\nIn regard to average rainfall conditions, additional insight is provided by the distinction between short-term and long-term migrations. Results from the previous section indicated that men from the drier regions were much more likely to migrate to rural areas than those from wetter regions. Table 6 shows that this is to a large extent the result of their much higher propensity to engage in short-term moves (21.43 *** ), although permanent migrations to rural areas are also more likely among people from the drier regions (2.18). The same conclusion applies to women. The risk of shortterm migration to urban areas is also higher (although not significantly) among males (3.09) and females (2.17) living in the drier regions. Finally, the odds of a short-term migration to a foreign country is slightly higher    among males living in regions with scarce rainfall (1.61), and lower among females (0.73). These results thus indicate that men from regions with scarce and irregular rainfall are much more likely to engage in temporary migration, mainly to other rural areas and to a lesser extent to urban and foreign destinations. This agrees with results from two small-scale studies in Burkina Faso (Homewood, 1999;Reardon et al., 1988), and supports the idea that short-term migration is a way to diversify income sources in a context of severe production variability (Reardon et al., 1988). Interestingly, people living in agro-climatically poor regions are also more likely to leave their village permanently for another place in rural areas (2.37 ** for men, 2.46 *** for women). On the other hand, they seem rather less likely to engage in long-term migration foreign destinations than their counterparts in wetter areas.\\nThe distinction between short-term and long-term moves also offers new insight into the link between rainfall variability and the risk of leaving the village. Overall, it seems that poor rainfall conditions in the previous years do not increase the risk of undertaking a short-term move 18 . While there is a slight increase of temporary migrations to rural areas (2.25 * ), males are in fact significantly less likely to move abroad for a short duration (0.37 ** ), and there is no relationship for migrations to urban areas. The lower risk of moving abroad following poor rainfall conditions might be explained by the fact that such moves entail higher costs than moving to less distant areas. On the other hand, the odds of long-term male migration to rural areas do significantly increase in bad years (1.64 * ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that people might decide to move permanently after severe rainfall deficits. The opposite effect is observed among females though: women are more likely to leave their village permanently for another village following years of relatively high rainfall. Given that most long-term female migrations to rural areas are marriage migrations, one tentative explanation might be that marriages tend to be delayed in periods of climatic stress. This runs counter to the hypothesis of increased marriages in drought periods as suggested by Findley (1994).',\n",
       "  'DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION': \"The influence of environmental factors on migration has been the object of increased interest over the last few years (Lonergan, 1998). Because of the large environmental disparities within the country and the significant proportion of the rural population involved in agriculture, Burkina Faso is an interesting setting in which to investigate the links between environ-mental conditions and migration. Using recent longitudinal multilevel data, event history models were used to test the effects of rainfall conditions and community-level characteristics on the first migration, in addition to classical socio-demographic individual factors.\\nThe main hypothesis was that individuals who live in areas with unfavorable rainfall conditions -including long-term conditions and shortterm fluctuations -are expected to have a higher risk of leaving their village than those who live in areas with more favorable rainfall conditions. The findings for the environmental variables, of special interest in this paper, show the following points. First, there is no evidence of an effect of rainfall conditions on the risk of first migration from rural areas when no distinction by destination or duration is made. This suggests that environmental conditions either have no effect on migration, or that opposing effects are at play depending on the type of migration. Overall, these results suggest that migration behaviour is not very responsive to community-level variables and to environmental factors as measured by rainfall variables, but rather depends on individual characteristics such as the educational level, the type of activity or the ethnic group to which the individual belongs. Although these results are somewhat surprising, the absence of a relationship between rainfall variability and migration agrees with results of the 1974-1975 National Migration Survey (Coulibaly & Vaugelade, 1981). Opinion data from that survey showed that the vast majority of people declared that their migration behaviour had not been affected by the drought conditions, and only a low 4% of migrants declared that they had moved because of the drought. This is all the more surprising given that the early 1970s were characterised by a severe drought 19 . One explanation suggested by the authors was that the effect of the drought on migration was weakened by massive food distribution. The same explanation was offered by Findley to account for the fact that the volume of migration had not risen during the 1983-1985 drought in Mali (Findley, 1994). Coulibaly and Vaugelade (1981) also advanced the idea that the effect of poor rainfall conditions on migration was not more apparent was because all migrations were considered together, with no distinction by sex, destination or migration type.\\nThe effect of rainfall conditions was then hypothesized to be different depending on the destination and the duration of migrations. In the case of Burkina Faso, the distinctions by destination and duration of migration prove critical in measuring a relationship between rainfall conditions and the risk of leaving the village. Overall, results indicate that environmental conditions as measured by rainfall variables are indeed linked to migratory behaviour, but in rather intricate ways depending on the varying types of migrations. A significant result from our models is that men and women living in areas where rainfall is scarce are much more likely to leave their village for another village (rural-rural migration) than are those living in areas with greater rainfall. This greater propensity to leave is to a large extent the consequence of their greater tendency to engage in short-term moves, which supports the theory that short-term migrations are part of a strategy to diversify income sources in a risky environment (Hampshire & Randall, 1999;Reardon et al., 1988). Interestingly, overall short-term migrations do not rise following a severe rainfall deficit: international temporary migrations are in fact less common among males in such periods. The former result agrees with a study on migrations in northern Burkina Faso that suggested that there was no increase in migrations in periods of drought (Homewood, 1999). The second result suggests that, rather than encouraging migration, rainfall deficits and bad harvests tend to limit people's ability to invest in long-distance moves (Findley, 1994). Overall, long-term migrations seem to be less related to environmental conditions than shortterm moves, and the effects also differ across gender. In short, men are more likely to move permanently to another village if they live in a region where rainfall is scarce and in years following poor rainfall conditions. This is consistent with the hypothesis that migration rises immediately and as a long-term response to the threat of recurrent droughts (Findley, 1994). While women are also more likely to leave their village for another village if they live in the drier regions, they are less likely to move after bad rainfall conditions. Permanent migrations to urban areas seem to be less related to rainfall conditions. Finally, men and women from better watered areas are more likely to engage in a long-term migration to a foreign country than those living in the drier regions.\\nThe results of this paper should not be considered as definitive and further research is needed on several topics. This study focused on the first migration, which is only one part of the story. Further analyses could investigate the effect of environmental conditions on subsequent migrations from rural areas. Perhaps more importantly, it could be fruitful to examine the effect of environmental conditions of the village of origin on the risk of returning to that village. One might expect that those leaving better-off places would be more likely to return to their home-village than those leaving places where rainfall is scarce. In fact, our results that distinguish migrations by duration tend to suggest that this is not the case, but more work is needed on this topic. Looking at exactly where migrants move and what they do in their new place of residence could also inform on their underlying motives for leaving their village. Many additional individual, household, community and environmental variables also remain to be investigated. Individual and household economic conditions, secondary activities, the spread of parasitic plants and the availability of off-farm activities in the community are some of the possible candidates for the formulation of more complex models. Other environmental factors could also be taken into account in migration models. The effects of land degradation on the risk of migration deserve special attention, although the lack of validated data at the national level constitutes a serious obstacle to the exploration of this issue. Finally, the characteristics of potential destinations could also be taken into account in further research (Baydar et al., 1990), although this would lead to more complex models and would require data that are not readily available. Such research will further our efforts to explain the complex interactions of the factors which influence migration in Burkina Faso.\",\n",

       "  'ENDNOTES': \"1. Results from the survey used in this study, ''Migration Dynamics, Urban Integration and Environment Survey of Burkina Faso''. 2. One should note at this point that only those international migrants who had returned to Burkina Faso were included in the survey. As a result, the proportion of international migrants who return to their village is overestimated. However, analyses using information collected from other household members on international migrants who had not returned by the time of the survey confirm that these have a much higher probability of returning to their village. 3. Migration Dynamics, Urban Integration and Environment Survey of Burkina Faso (EMIUB for Enquete ''Dynamique migratoire, Insertion urbaine et environnement au Burkina Faso''). 4. Burkina Faso is composed of approximately 350 departments. 5. Rural areas include all communities of less than 10 000 inhabitants (Beauchemin et al., 2002).\\n6. The individuals entering the risk set in 1970 may be more than 15 years old at the time of entry. This is a situation of late entry into the risk set that is easily handled in discrete-time event history models (Allison, 1995). 7. A 3-month migration definition was used to include temporary migrations in the dry season and migration related to short-term activities in urban areas (Poirier et al., 2001). 8. Models with dichotomous indicators of each age were also estimated. The estimates of the other coefficients in these models did not change. We thus chose the more parsimonious parametric specification of the baseline hazard. 9. The educational level does not vary very much after the age of 15. 10. The timing of the rains (delays in the start of the rainy season, occurrence of rains in relation to crop growth stages) could also be an important factor. The intra-annual variability of rainfall was also tested but not used in this study because this variable was not correlated with bad harvests. 11. This categorization was arbitrarily defined but several tests were performed to test the robustness of the results. 12. This information was collected in two stages. A first question was asked about the availability of uncleared land in the village at the time of the survey. In the communities in which uncleared land was no longer available, respondents were then asked to recall the (approximate) year when uncleared land was last available. 13. Preliminary analyses indicate a strong relationship between the availability of uncleared land in the village and population density measured at the province level. 14. Due to the absence of data at the household level, the presence of contour walls in a community is assumed to equally affect all community members. 15. This could be explained by the lower age at marriage among Fulani females. Since a larger proportion of Fulani females are already married by age 15, they will probably be less likely to move after that age. 16. One should note that this variable may be endogenous and that its measured effects should be interpreted with caution. For example, given that the implementation of such techniques requires a significant involvement of the workforce, the observed result for migrations to rural and urban areas might be partly explained by a greater probability of implementing soil and water conservation techniques in places where male migration is low. Further research is thus needed to fully understand the measured effects. 17. This definition is similar to that used by De Jong, Chamratrithirong, & Tran, (2002). 18. Models that only distinguish short-term and long-term moves (results not shown) in fact indicate that short-term migrations are significantly less likely following severe rainfall deficits. 19. Similar results were reported in Ethiopia where less than 2% of people mentioned drought as the cause for leaving their parent's home (Ezra, 2000).\"},\n",
       " 16: {'abstract': 'This study tests the influence of environmental changes on migration in Burkina Faso. It describes individual migratory pathways in the 1960-1999 period in Burkina Faso, using environmental typologies of origins and destinations based on rainfall variations and land degradation. The study links data from a national longitudinal (retrospective) survey with fine resolution rainfall data and land degradation data. Results suggest that environmental factors influence, but in different ways, both the probability to out-migrate and the selection of a destination once the migration decision has been made. Migration seems to be more influenced by a slow-acting process such as land degradation than by episodic events such as droughts.',\n",
       "  'INTRODUCTION': \"The meagre literature dealing with the effects of the environment on migration is divided between the minimalist view, for which changes in the natural environment is just a contextual variable that may influence human movements, and the maximalist view, for which environmental degradation is causing large migrations (Suhrke, 1994). Migrations could be caused by environmental change through changes in structural economic conditions (e.g., a reduction of average income), risk effects (by increasing the instability of income) or social effects (by positive or negative environmental externalities) (Bilsborrow, 1991). Migration may be viewed as being just one coping strategy among others (Bates, 2002;Findley, 1992;Suhrke, 1994).\\nSome authors have put forward the concept of ''environmental refugees'' (Bates, 2002;Hugo, 1996;Kibreab, 1994;NewScientist, 1989;Ramlogan, 1996). The 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and Stateless Persons specified that, to be a refugee, ''the person has to be outside his or her country of origin for reason of persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of particular social group or political opinion.'' (Refugee Convention, UNTS No. 2545). In the Convention, internal migrations were not included. The notion of ''forced migration'', as opposed to voluntary movements, helped authors to make the distinction between environmental refugees and environmental migrants. Hugo (1996) and Bates (2002) identified a continuum with forced migration of environmental refugees on one end of the spectrum, voluntary movement by migrants on the other end, and environmental migrations at the centre. Many migratory flows are not easy to classify in one of these categories. As mentioned by Bates (2002, p. 467), as an example: ''Refugee flows usually contain anticipatory refugees. These people recognise that their local situation will eventually deteriorate and have the ability to relocate before they are forced to do so.''\\nThe problem of using the term ''environmental migration'' comes from the various causes of environmental change. The concept encompasses, on one hand, natural disasters (volcanic eruption, floods, earthquake, etc.) producing an unintentional migration and, on the other hand, the gradual deterioration of environmental conditions caused by factors endogenous to the local population and which contributes to migration decisions. Bates (2002, p. 473) distinguished between the two forms: ''disaster and expropriation refugees have limited control over whether environmental changes will produce migration. In contrast, environmental emigrants determine how they respond to environmental change.'' An appropriate response is facilitated by the fact that the impact of land degradation is gradual (Suhrke, 1994).\\nA large part of the literature on environmental refugees or migrants aims at quantifying their number. Hugo (1996) reported that a million environmental refugees were pushed by the drought of 1968-1973 in Burkina Faso alone. Myers (1997) wrote that, worldwide, there are about 25 million environmental refugees, mainly located in Sub-Saharan Africa and claimed that this figure can be doubled by 2010. He added that 135 million people were already threatened by severe desertification and thus would migrate in the near future. All these estimates must be taken with caution however because the concept is vague, and the literature suffers from a lack of detailed case studies which would have measured precisely the size of flows.\\nIn Burkina Faso, the 1974-1975 National Migration Survey attempted, among other things, to study the impact of the early 1970s drought on migration (Coulibaly, Gregory, & Piche ´, 1980). Among the people who migrated between 1969 and 1975, less than 10% declared that they experienced a lack of water or food. Among the non-migrants, only 12% declared that they did experience a drought in their village in 1975. Few estimated that the drought pushed people to leave. However these survey results should be taken with caution given inherent biases in the replies to a question on the motives of migration (men generally respond that they migrate to earn more money or because crop yields are too low, and women that they migrate for family reasons). Motives declared by respondents could be different from the underlying factors influencing their migration. Some motives announced by migrants could be an indirect consequence of droughts, such as the reduction in savings or a decline in crop yields. In the current study, rainfall data were used to define drought conditions, independently of the motives of migration declared by migrants or of external classifications. Using an accurate definition of rainfall variability, a previous study in Burkina Faso showed indeed that migration is associated with rainfall anomalies within the season and drought frequency in provinces at the origin (Henry, Boyle, & Lambin, 2003).\\nDuring the famine following the 1972-1973 drought in northern Nigeria, Mortimore (1989) showed that the number of villages reporting out-migration jumped from 26 to 43% and a further 51% reported empty houses whose owners were still expected to return. Using data from a longitudinal panel study conducted in 1982and 1989in Mali, Findley (1992, 1994) demonstrated that the level of migration did not rise during the drought of 1983-1985. However, there was a dramatic increase in the migration of women and children and a shift to short-cycle circulation during the severe drought. De Bruijn and Van Dijk (2003) studied the rural-rural migration of pastoral Fulbe families in three districts in Mali. They observed an individualised pattern of migration, motivated by economic and ecological factors. Since the onset of the droughts, many families and many young men left their village in the studied districts.\\nConcerning land degradation, Thapa and Bilsborrow (1995) indicated that in Nepal, some settlers sold their allotted land to purchase better quality land elsewhere (Kansakar, 1985). Ezra and Kiros (2001) used a household survey carried out in the drought-prone and ecologically degraded rural areas of Ethiopia to study rural out-migration over the 1984-1994 period. A multi-level analysis was performed by introducing, among other variables, the community's vulnerability to food crisis in the regression model. The results showed that this variable contributes significantly to out-migration to assist relatives. Migration for marriage was considerably lower during the famine year than in any other period. However, the environmental variable used in this study was very simple and based on an assessment by local institutions, which is probably different from the assessment by migrants of their environmental hardship. Moreover, the vulnerability assessment cannot be assumed to be equally applicable to all regions in Ethiopia.\\nIn sum, the few previous studies on the impact of land degradation on migration suggest a slight and geographically limited influence. There is some empirical evidence on the influence of drought on migration but the migratory response does not take a unique form. However, these empirical evidences are limited by a lack of appropriate data. Either these studies were confined to a small geographical or ethnical area, or the definition of the environmental variable(s) was very simple. Often, only one drought event was studied, therefore missing the cumulative aspect of the influence of environmental conditions on migration.\\nThe aim of this study was to test the impact of the natural environment on migration in Burkina Faso. It describes the individual migratory pathways in the 1960-1999 period, in Burkina Faso, based on an environmental typology of origins and destinations. This typology includes environmental conditions related both to rainfall variations and land degradation. The study tested two hypotheses. The first one concerns the conditions at the origin (push factors): individuals who lived in an area with unfavourable environmental conditions were quicker to quit their residence than individuals who lived in an area with favourable environmental conditions (hypothesis 1). This hypothesis was tested by using ''the survivor function'' methodology (as explained below). The second hypothesis concerns the conditions at the destination (pull fac-tors): migrants choose proportionally more often areas with favourable environmental conditions than areas with unfavourable environmental conditions for their destination (hypothesis 2). This hypothesis was tested by using the ''conditional probability'' methodology (as explained below). Each of these two hypotheses was tested first for environmental conditions defined according to climatic variables, and second according to land degradation data.\",\n",
       "  'STUDY AREA': \"Burkina Faso has a gradient of environmental conditions, from the Sahelian environment in the North where rainfall is sparse and irregular, and soils are poor, to the southwestern region where rainfall is higher and more regular, and where soil conditions are much more favourable for agriculture. The population distribution does not match environmental suitability for agriculture: the centre-north plateau is densely populated while the southwestern region has a lower density of settlements. Some authors (Gray, 1999;Mathieu, 1998;Tallet, 1993) argue that a large migratory movement is taking place from the former area to the latter, mostly to cultivate cash crops (cotton). Migrants were also encouraged by a national resettlement programme, the 'Ame ´nagement des Valle ´es des Voltas' (AVV) developed in 1974, to occupy the valleys of the Volta rivers which had been freed from onchorcercosis (Cordell, Gregory, & Piche ´, 1996;Oue ´draogo, 1986). This ''river blindness'' disease has been prevalent in the savannah regions of Burkina Faso, Benin, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Niger and Togo, and has been largely eradicated.\\nSince 1960, Burkina Faso experienced two severe droughts during 1968-1973, and 1983to 1985(Hulme, 2001;;Nicholson, 2001). Droughts in the Sahelian region allegedly amplified large-scale migratory flows from the dry zone to the coastal areas (Makinwa-Adebusoye, 1995). The decrease in soil productivity is also generally assumed to be a determinant of migration. Farmers from the Mossi ethnic group for example, experiencing severe land degradation due partly to inappropriate agricultural practices, are widely believed to migrate to search for more fertile land (Mathieu, 1993).\\nHowever, the reality of land degradation in Burkina Faso remains contested. On the basis of an assessment by regional experts (the GLA-SOD map, in Oldeman, Hakkeling, & Sombroeck, 1990), a large part of the country was considered to be degraded, mostly in the centre-north plateau. Recently, Niemeijer and Mazzucato (2002) suggested that neither agricultural soil productivity, calculated as the total energetic value per hectare produced by all major food crops, nor soil chemical fertility had significantly declined over the last few decades in Burkina Faso. Only a loss of organic matter was found for lowland soils. Nevertheless, empirical data on land degradation are sparse and it is difficult to identify consistent processes of land-cover change from time series of data. For example, in the landscape of vegetation-fixed dune systems in northern Burkina Faso, Lindqvist and Tengberg (1993) used aerial photographs and satellite images to reveal severe land degradation, which occurred mostly during the late 1960s. More recently, these areas experienced a recovery of vegetation with a change in species composition (Rasmussen, Fog, & Madsen, 2001).\\nIn terms of population, Burkina Faso counted 10,312,609 inhabitants, with 51.8% of female and 47.9% of children younger than 15 (according to the population census survey of 1996, INSD, 1998). In 1996, Burkina Faso counted 45 provinces and 351 departments where about 30,000 inhabitants lived (Figure 1). Provinces around Ouagadougou, the capital, are densely populated (more than 50 inhabitants per km 2 ) and the country experienced large disparities in population density. Burkina Faso has always been characterised by important migratory dynamics (Cordell et al., 1996). Results from the census of 1985 (INSD, 1990) showed that 4% of the population migrated during the preceding year. International migrations, principally to the Co ˆte d'Ivoire, mostly involved young men hoping to gain a maximum of money in a short period of time (Cordell et al., 1996). According to the 1996 population census survey, Burkina Faso has an increasingly negative migratory balance, compared to the previous population census survey in 1985 (INSD, 2000). Internal migrations were principally directed to a rural destination (78% of migrants in 1985). Flows to urban areas were concentrated toward the two largest cities, Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.\",\n",
       "  'DATA': 'Reliable national scale data on demographic, socio-economic and biophysical factors, collected for consistent geographical units and over similar periods of time, are rarely available in Africa; Burkina Faso is an exception. This study was based on a large longitudinal and national-scale demographic survey coupled with the most current rainfall and land degradation data.  (Poirier et al., 2001). Households (3570) were sampled in eight strata: five rural regions (the Sahel, the East, the West, the Southwest and the Centre) and three cities (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso and Banforah). These strata were chosen according to geographic, climatic and ethnic criteria and by respecting the provincial division. From these households, each individual between 25 and 64 years old, and one individual in every two for the age bracket of 15-24 years old were interviewed. The reason to proceed in this way is to take into account the relatively large weight of the youngest age group in the Burkinabe ´population (15-24), as well as their highly censored biography. A total of 9612 biographies were collected by retrospective survey, including the emigrants of the households for whom information is limited. This information was given by the other household members.',\n",
       "  'Demographic Data': \"The household questionnaire included questions on the characteristics of household members (sex, age, place of birth, ethnic group, education, economic activity, etc.), characteristics of household emigrants (sex, age, date of departure, destination, activity, instruction, etc.), housing and household's economic situation (type of parcel, occupation status of the household, etc.), household's environment (water, cesspool, etc.) and household expenses for cooking fuel (in urban areas only). The biographic questionnaire covered family origins and childhood (sex, age, place of birth, etc.), residential mobility (date and place of installation, status of residence, land access, purpose of migration, etc.), economic activities (instruction level, activity status, etc.), matrimonial history (union, celebration, husband, etc.), birth history (number of children, childdeath, contraception, etc).\\nThe present study was based on the questions related to residential mobility. Each residence of more than 3 months since the 6th birthday of the individual was registered. For this study, the definition of a migration was restricted to an inter-departmental change of residence of more than one year. Population movements of less than one year were not analysed to minimise the bias related to the memory of the individuals. Actually, we assume that it is easier to remember long lasting compared to temporary movements. Note that migrations of more than one year concerns 94% of all recorded movements.\\nThe migration age was also limited from 20 to 40 years old, to exclude movements of children following their parents. After the age of 40, the study was constrained by the small number of cases, as migration is less frequent after this age. Migrations with the aim of studying were excluded because these movements are unlikely to be influenced by environmental conditions. Finally, this study was restricted to migrations by men since almost all women are married by the age of 20 and therefore follow their husband.\",\n",
       "  'Rainfall Data': 'Rainfall data were extracted from the global monthly precipitation data set provided by the Climatic Research Unit based on New, Hulme and Jones (2000). These data were extrapolated from a network of rainfall stations at a 0.5°latitude/longitude resolution. Rainfall data were aggregated at the department level. The analysis was limited to the period from 1960 to 1998 given the large number of missing data prior to 1960. These data are very consistent with other rainfall databases such as the rainfall data provided by the Global Historical Climatology Network and those provided by the Direction nationale de la Me ´te ´orologie au Burkina Faso.',\n",
       "  'Land Degradation Data': 'Land degradation was measured by remote sensing at the departmentlevel. The net annual increase in biomass, or net primary production (NPP), is a measure of the productivity of an ecosystem (Nicholson, Tucker, & Ba, 1998). The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured by remote sensing was used as a proxy of NPP. In the northern parts of the Sahel, NPP is largely determined by rainfall, whereas in the central and southern parts of the zone the influence of soil fertility also becomes significant. The NDVI is not an adequate indicator of land degradation per se since it is sensitive to interannual rainfall variability. The rain use efficiency (RUE), calculated as the ratio between net primary production and precipitation (as in Prince, De Colstoun, & Kravitz, 1998), is a more useful indicator of land degradation because it normalizes NPP by rainfall. Land degradation is associated with a reduction in RUE over several years. However, RUE is not sensitive to species composition. Changes in forage species composition and therefore grazing quality associated with degradation are not measured by RUE. According to Prince et al. (1998), there was no dramatic downward trend in RUE between 1982 and 1990 in the Sahel. On the contrary, there was a small but significantly upward trend in RUE. However, this observation at the regional scale is entirely compatible with observations of serious land degradation at the local scale.\\nTo calculate RUE, the NDVI time series from the Pathfinder NOAA AVHRR satellite data were used as a proxy to net primary production. NDVI data are available at the resolution of 8 • 8 km, from 1982 to 1995. Three years (1989, 1991 and 1994) were excluded because of late equator crossing time of the NOAA satellite (for more details, see Gutman, 1999) or atmospheric contamination from the Mount Pinatubo eruption.',\n",
       "  'METHODOLOGY': \"Individual migration pathways composed of one or more migrations were extracted from the longitudinal demographic survey data. Each residence was associated with time-independent variables related to individual attributes and time-dependent variables related to the residence at destination. Rainfall and land degradation data were linked to the database, with the department as a common spatial unit and the year as the common time unit. To describe migratory pathways, two environmental typologies of origins and destinations were used: a climatic and a land degradation typology. The favourable or unfavourable character of each department was defined, as explained below, for each year for the ''climatic'' definition, and for the entire period for the ''land degradation'' definition.\",\n",
       "  'Methodology to Define the Favourable or Unfavourable Climatic Character': 'The definition of the favourable or unfavourable climatic character was based on three rainfall variables. The first variable is the mean annual precipitation during the 1960-1998 period, with only one value per department for the entire period. This variable represents the agro-climatic zones in Burkina Faso: the Sahelian region (with an annual rainfall lower than 600 mm per year), the Sudanian region (between 600 and 800 mm per year) and the guineo-congolian/Sudanian region (higher than 800 mm per year). The second variable represents the inter-annual variability in rainfall. It is measured by the ratio between the annual rainfall of the year under consideration and the 1960-1998 annual mean rainfall. Departments were clustered in three groups: current annual rainfall lower than 50%, between 50 and 80%, or higher than 80% of the 1960-1998 mean annual rainfall. 1 The third variable is an intra-seasonal variability index which accounts for rainfall variation during the vegetative period. It is measured as the number of months during the growing season for which precipitation was lower than 50% of the 1960-1998 mean rainfall for the corresponding months, for the same area.\\nFor each agro-climatic zone, specific thresholds were fixed on the two latter variables to define the favourable or unfavourable climatic character (Table 1). We assumed that the impact on livelihood strategies of a lowerthan-usual rainfall is likely to be more dramatic in the northern drier than in the southern wetter part of the country. A residence was considered as being in an unfavourable department based on the climatic conditions for the years before the residence change took place. Specifically, the department at year t was considered to be in unfavourable climatic conditions if the department was in unfavourable climatic conditions during 2 out of the 3 years before the date of residence change. We assumed that it is not possible to survive more than 2 or 3 years on the cereal stocks accumulated during the good years because of the limited surplus production and the low food storage and conservation capacity. Thus, the definition of the favourable or unfavourable climatic character was different for every year, for each department. Depending on the year, from 0 to 42% of the departments were defined as enduring unfavourable climatic conditions according to the index composed by the three variables.',\n",
       "  'Methodology to Define the Favourable or Unfavourable Land Degradation Character': \"Unlike rainfall variations, land degradation is a slow-acting process. Only areas with a downward trend in rain-use efficiency, over the period 1982-1995, were considered as being degraded. A statistically significant negative slope of the regression of RUE against time was used to define degraded areas. The absolute value of the RUE for each year does not provide a useful land degradation metrics as it is influenced by locationspecific factors. Land degradation is best revealed by the interannual trend in RUE in a given location. Because the scale of this study is limited to the departmental level, a department was considered to be in unfavourable TABLE 1 Thresholds to define the Favourable (+) or Unfavourable ()) Climatic\\nCharacter, for Each Year\\nC A B < 50% 50-80% 80% et + <600 mm 0 ) ) + 1 et + ) ) )\\n600-800 mm 0-1 land degradation conditions if a significant proportion (fixed as >50%) of its area was degraded.

This study compared survivor functions for migrants who settled in areas with favourable and unfavourable environmental conditions. The idea of the survivor function is to follow a population of individuals all beginning a certain migration episode with origin residence j at the same point in time (the episode's starting time), which, for this study, is the arrival in the first residence after the age of 20. 2 As time goes on, emigrations occur (i.e. individuals leave the given origin residence). The survivor function gives the probability of staying in the residence beyond a time t. As the number of years t since the arrival in the first residence increases, the probability of staying decreases and thus the probability of migrating increases. Also known as the product-limit estimator, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator is the most widely used method for estimating survivor functions (Allisson, 1995). A probability is calculated by dividing the number of non-migrants (or stayers) by the population at risk which is composed by all individuals of 20 and over in the origin area. Biographies were not complete for individuals which were not yet 40 years old at the time of the survey as these individuals could still migrate after the end of the survey. Such observations are referred to as right censored cases. The KM method was used to include the information on a censored person up to the time of censorship, rather than simply ignoring all the information on a censored person (Kleinbaum, 1996). A KM survival probability at event time t (j) is the probability of surviving past the previous event time t (j)1) , multiplied by the conditional probability of surviving past time t (j) , given survival to at least time t (j) . This method was used to test the first hypothesis of the study -i.e., that the individuals who lived in an area with unfavourable environmental conditions were quicker to leave their residence than individuals who lived in an area with favourable environmental conditions. In this section, no distinction was made between destinations.\",\n",
       "  'The Use of Conditional Probabilities to Describe Individual Pathways': 'The life histories of individuals were analysed by the use of the non-Markovian portion of the LIFEHIST software (created by Rajulton, 1991). This creates multiple-decrement life tables with the assumption that previous experiences of events affect subsequent transitions. The individuals are followed from an initial state. Four states were defined: (i) residence in a rural area with unfavourable environmental conditions, (ii) residence in a rural area with favourable environmental conditions, (iii) residence in an urban area and (iv) residence in a foreign country. The conditional probability to migrate from one state to another was calculated to predict the occurrence of a migration event, considering previous migrations. The algorithm preserves the different sequences of events already integrated when estimating the probability of experiencing a succeeding event. Note that LIFEHIST weights the conditional probabilities to consider the sampling scheme of the survey. LIFEHIST takes into account right censoring for the probability calculation, by removing the censored individuals from the population at risk of migrating. By reducing the denominator of the probability calculation, the probability is greater than the probability calculation without taking into account the right censoring. This increase reflects the fact that the censored individuals could still migrate after the end of the survey. LIFEHIST computes the number of persons at risk and the probabilities to migrate from one state to another but does not provide the exact number of migrants who experienced a specific migration. The difference between a probability and actual figures depends on the number of censored cases. This number can be estimated by applying to the population at risk of migrating from one state to another the probability of going through this migration. In this study, however, figures cannot be extrapolated to the national scale since the sampling scheme of the survey was not designed to represent environmental disparities. The behaviour of the few interviewed individuals can not be assumed to be representative of their environmental group but they are assumed to be representative of their stratum, as defined in the survey.\\nThe initial state was the first residence with the mentioned characteristics -unfavourable or favourable -after the age of 20. Firstly, the initial state was a rural area with unfavourable environmental conditions. Secondly, the initial state was set to be a rural area with favourable environmental conditions. This method was used to test the second hypothesis of the study -i.e., that migrants choose proportionally more often areas with favourable environmental conditions than areas with unfavourable environmental conditions for their destination. Note that the LIFEHIST software does not offer a significance test of differences between groups.\\nThe two methods -the survivor function and the analysis of migratory pathways -do not study the same migrations. The survivor function only analyses the first migrations, all origins being confounded, whereas the analysis of migratory pathways also deals with second or third migrations, depending on the characteristics of the residence. For example (Figure 2), in the analysis of the survivor function, the first studied residence of this individual is the number 2, the first one after the age of 20. This residence is located in an area with favourable conditions. With the analysis of migratory pathways from an area with unfavourable conditions, the first studied residence of this individual is the number 3. It is the first residence, after the age of 20 with the characteristic of unfavourable conditions. For this individual, this migration is the second one after the age of 20. In this latter approach, no restriction on the order of migration was chosen, to increase the number of studied individuals and thus the possibility to study more than one migratory step. ',\n",
       "  'RESULTS': \"Survivor Function Related to the Origin Conditions (Test of Hypothesis 1)\\nThe first hypothesis concerns the conditions at the origin (push factors): individuals who lived in an area with unfavourable environmental conditions were quicker to quit their residence than individuals who lived in an area with favourable environmental conditions. Fifty percent of individuals migrated after 7 years in their residence, whatever the environmental characteristics of origins. 3 Surprisingly, the proportion of the population that did not migrate at all after 15 years at their residence was 35% in departments with unfavourable climatic conditions and only 23% in departments with better environmental conditions (Figure 3). Differences between these two groups are significant (Log-rank test) but not during the first years (Wilcoxon test). Note that the number of studied individuals varied as a function of the origin (143 from an area with unfavourable climatic conditions and 528 from an area with favourable climatic conditions). Thus, less people migrate out of areas Thirty one percent of the population who lived in a department with unfavourable land degradation conditions did not yet migrate after 20 years in their residence, while they were only 11% in this case among those who lived in areas with better environmental conditions (Figure 4). Thus, the observation on the low outmigration rate from areas with unfavourable land degradation conditions is similar to the one concerning areas with unfavourable climatic conditions.\\nThese results do not support the first hypothesis of the study. Actually, contrary to what was expected, people from areas with unfavourable land degradation and climatic conditions migrate less out of their first residence than individuals from areas with favourable conditions. Rather than encouraging migration, unfavourable environmental conditions in combination with other non-environmental factors may limit people's ability to invest in migration. Migratory Pathways from Areas with Unfavourable Climatic Conditions (Test of Hypothesis 2)\\nThe second hypothesis concerns the conditions at the destination (pull factors): migrants choose proportionally more often areas with favourable environmental conditions than areas with unfavourable environmental conditions for their destination. 1287 men -out of 6815 studied menlived in rural areas with unfavourable climatic conditions after the age of 20 (Figure 5). From this residence, 1% 4 of the sampled population was likely to migrate to another rural area with unfavourable climatic conditions, 4% to a rural area with favourable climatic conditions, 5% to an urban area, and 47% to a foreign country. 43% of the studied individuals (1287) were likely to stay in their first residence between the age of 20 and 40. 37% of those who had migrated once to a rural area with favourable climatic conditions were likely to experience a second migration to another rural area with favourable climatic conditions before their fortieth birthday, 7% of them to a rural area with unfavourable climatic conditions and 2% to an urban area. Those who had chosen an urban or foreign destination in their first migration were likely to move almost exclusively in their second migration back to a rural area, more often with unfavourable climatic conditions (50%) than with favourable climatic conditions (20%). This is likely to represent largely a return migration to the origin. One percent was likely to move to an urban area in their second migration if their destination in their first migration was a foreign country, and to a foreign country if their destination was an urban area. Twenty nine percent were likely to remain settled in a foreign country until their 40th birthday after their first migration. Note that, according to the climatic criteria used, the same area could be unfavourable at the year of departure and become favourable at the year of return.\\nMigration from a department with favourable climatic conditions as origin was mainly directed to foreign destinations (52%) (Figure 5). When these migrations were aimed at a rural destination in the country, it was almost exclusively to a rural area with favourable climatic conditions (8%). In the second step of migration, rural areas with favourable climatic conditions were always preferred, all origins confounded.\\nIn summary, this analysis showed that a large proportion of the population living in an area with unfavourable climatic conditions was likely to move between the age of 20 and 40. Among those that migrated, a foreign country was the most frequent destination in the first migration. Note that Co ˆte d'Ivoire, the most frequent destination for Burkinabe migrants, benefits from favourable environmental conditions compared to all departments of Burkina Faso. Burkinabe ´migrants are not likely pulled by rainfall conditions in Co ˆte d'Ivoire but are rather attracted by job opportunities in plantations of cafe and cacao. Most of the international migrants came back in Burkina before their fortieth birthday, in their second migration. The Burkinabe ´living abroad indeed maintain ties with villages of origin and with family networks (Cordell et al., 1996). The most frequent destinations of these return migrants are their village of origin. These migrations are thus unlikely to be linked to environmental conditions.\\nThe second hypothesis (migrants choose proportionally more often areas with climatically favourable environmental conditions than areas with unfavourable climatic conditions as their destination) is confirmed. Whether it concerns the first or second migration, and whether migrants originated from departments with favourable or unfavourable climatic conditions, departments with favourable climatic conditions were a much more frequent destination chosen by individuals than departments with unfavourable climatic conditions.\",\n",
       "  'Migratory Pathways from Areas with Unfavourable Land Degradation Conditions (Test of Hypothesis 2)': 'Origins which were unfavourable in terms of land degradation rather than climatic conditions were much often associated with migration. Actually, 82% of individuals living in a rural area with unfavourable land degradation conditions were likely to outmigrate, compared to 57% for areas with unfavourable climatic conditions. A foreign country was the destination of 73% of the migrants originating from a department with unfavourable land degradation conditions (Figure 6). 5% of all migrants (478) were likely to move to a rural area with favourable land degradation conditions, 3% to a rural area with unfavourable land degradation conditions and 1% to an urban area.\\nIn the case of migrations from areas with favourable land degradation conditions, 18% of migrants were likely to leave to a foreign country, 13% to a rural area with favourable land degradation conditions, 4% to an urban area and only 0.5% to a rural area with unfavourable land degradation conditions. The probability to migrate to any destination from a department with favourable land degradation conditions reaches only 35.5%, against 82% for those originating from a department with unfavourable land degradation conditions. In summary, departments with unfavourable land degradation conditions were a less frequent destination than departments with favourable conditions 5 . This was particularly the case when the origin was an area with favourable land degradation conditions. This supports the second hypothesis of this study.',\n",
       "  'CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION': \"Few studies have so far estimated the proportion of migrations that can be directly attributed to environmental conditions. In this study, a descriptive analysis of population movements between regions characterised by different rainfall and land degradation conditions was performed. The survivor function, used to analyse the influence of the conditions at the origin, showed that, from the age of 20, people from areas with unfavourable land degradation and climatic conditions migrate less out of their first residence than individuals from areas with favourable conditions. The destinations chosen by migrants were analysed by using conditional probabilities to describe individual pathways.\\nPeople leaving a rural area settle more often in a rural area with favourable environmental conditions than in an area with unfavourable conditions. This finding holds true for origins with favourable or unfavourable environmental conditions, and whether this was defined based on climatic or land degradation data. While the difference between the conditional probabilities to migrate to areas with favourable or unfavourable conditions was not very high, the odds were up to 1 to 10 in favour of areas with favourable environmental conditions. Results concerning the distribution of migrants among destinations were not sensitive to the criteria used to define the unfavourable or favourable climatic character of departments. In this paper, the department at year t was considered to be in unfavourable climatic conditions if the department was in unfavourable climatic conditions during 2 out of the 3 years before the date of residence change. Several durations (from 2 to 10 years) were considered and conclusions were similar.\\nWhether environmental conditions were defined based on rainfall or land degradation affected the proportion of people leaving their residence (not necessarily the first one). A large proportion (82%) of the population living in rural areas affected by land degradation outmigrated before the age of 40. That proportion was smaller (57%) for areas affected by poor climatic conditions. It may thus be assumed that migrations are likely to be more influenced by a slow-acting process such as land degradation than by episodic events such as droughts. Land degradation progressively makes livelihood strategies based on farming unsustainable. By contrast, a number of coping and adaptation strategies have made agropastoralism sustainable in semi-arid regions affected by climatic variability. Other factors are likely to interact however.\\nNote that, with the analysis of migratory pathways, a much larger proportion of the population residing in areas with unfavourable land degradation conditions outmigrates than it is the case with population residing in areas with favourable land degradation or climatic conditions, or even with unfavourable climatic conditions. These results may seem to contradict the conclusions of the analysis with the survivor function. The main difference between these two methods is the order of the analysed migration. With the survivor function, only the first migration is analysed. The attachment of an individual to his first residence is stronger than to the following residences. Moreover, unfavourable environmental conditions, by reducing or making difficult the production of a surplus (in food or money), limit people's ability to invest in migration by comparison to areas of residence with favourable environmental conditions. Therefore, people from areas with unfavourable land degradation and climatic conditions tend to migrate less out of their first residence than individuals from areas with favourable conditions.\\nHowever, in the analysis of migratory pathways using conditional probabilities, it could be the second, the third (or over) migration that is analysed. The probability to migrate is known to be increasing with the migration experience. Moreover, when the origin is not the first residence (as it is often the case with the method of migratory pathways by conditional probabilities), the attachment to a location is lower. Individuals who have already migrated would prefer not to stagnate in an area with unfavourable conditions and would prefer to migrate again to an area with favourable conditions.\\nThis study suffers from several limitations. It was based on data from a national longitudinal survey coupled with fine resolution rainfall data and land degradation data derived from time-series of remote sensing data. However, as for any survey data, the sampling scheme could influence conditional probabilities. This study could not take into account the difference in the potential of attraction between areas with favourable or unfavourable environmental conditions because the sampling scheme was not elaborated to take into account environmental disparities. The potential of attraction of areas with favourable conditions is greater than for areas with unfavourable environmental conditions as the former are much larger. Consequently, in this study, the object of the analysis is the individual migration and not the attractivity of places.\\nThe definitions of favourable and unfavourable environmental conditions are based on a rational scientific logic. The decision of the migrants is likely to be based not only on an objective but also on a subjective assessment. Moreover, all other things being equal, even if both their origins and destinations are located in areas with unfavourable environmental conditions, migrants may move to obtain a small ecological gain.\\nThe two descriptive techniques used in this study take censoring into account but the number of censored cases was relatively high for some origins. To consider the bias related to the memory of individuals, the duration of migrations was defined at a minimum of 1 year. However, Shrestha (1989, cited by Bates, 2002) explains that environmental migrants begin with a short-time journey, on reconnaissance. Finally, there is still no standard indicators measuring land degradation. This study used the rainuse efficiency, considered in the literature as a good proxy to provide largescale estimates but, at a local scale, Diouf and Lambin (2001) showed that this indicator has to be measured based on biomass data rather than on remotely-sensed vegetation index data. Some aspects of the effects of the environment on migration were not investigated in this study. The environmental conditions are likely to have a greater influence on the migration of farmers (the majority of the population) than of herders. Migration is just one coping strategy among others. Some potential migrants could anticipate unfavourable environmental conditions and move before suffering the next unfavourable year. Others could stay and develop non-farm activities. Furthermore, the effects of migration on the environment were not considered here. It is another but related problem as refugees are exceptional resource degraders (Leach, 1992, cited by Black & Sessay, 1997).\\nIs the environment a proximate or underlying cause of migration? Hugo (1996) states that ''the deeper underlying causes of environmental migration are not environmental but related to political, economic, sociological and demographic processes''. This study made possible the evaluation of the proportion of migrations that can be directly attributed to environmental conditions. The results suggest that environmental conditions interact with other factors to cause migration. Actually, the differences between conditional probabilities from areas with favourable and unfavourable environmental conditions were not very high. Unfavourable environmental conditions are thus unlikely to be the unique ''cause'' pushing people to migrate. Socio-demographic and economic disparities within Burkina Faso are also expected to explain migration. For example, population density and market opportunities largely differ across regions. Moreover, the interactions between environmental conditions, livelihood strategies and migrations are likely to be different in the pastoral production systems in the Sahelian part of the country compared to the rain-fed agricultural systems in the Sudanian zone. Pastoralists depend on mobility to cope with their harsh environment while farmers are more vulnerable to droughts and land degradation. Actually, farmers engaged in cotton cultivation for example largely depend on high crop yields to cover the cost of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. Finally, land degradation and inter-annual rainfall variability are not independent processes given that droughts may trigger or increase land degradation. Nevertheless, this study is one of the first to describe individual migratory pathways according to rainfall and land degradation typologies. In future analyses in search for causative relations, the interactions between multiple causes of migrations should be tested.\\n2. If the individual lives in birth department at age 20, the first residence to be analysed will be the next one. If he does not leave the home department, he is left-censored and not included in the analysis. 3. Recall that these figures have been weighted but not extrapolated. 4. In the following section, figures indicate conditional probabilities to migrate, not percentages. 5. Recall however that this concerns relatively low population numbers and that the LIFEHIST software does not offer a significance test of differences between groups.\"},\n",
       " 17: {'abstract': 'Scholarly understanding of human migration\\'s environmental dimensions has greatly advanced in the past several years, motivated in large part by public and policy dialogue around \"climate migrants\". The research presented here advances current demographic scholarship both through its substantive interpretations and conclusions, as well as its methodological approach. We examine temporary rural South African outmigration as related to household-level availability of proximate natural resources. Such \"natural capital\" is central to livelihoods in the region, both for sustenance and as materials for market-bound products. The results demonstrate that the association between local environmental resource availability and outmigration is, in general, positive: households with higher levels of proximate natural capital are more likely to engage in temporary migration. In this way, the general fi ndings support the \"environmental surplus\" hypothesis that resource security provides a foundation from which households can invest in migration as a livelihood strategy. Such insight stands in contrast to popular dialogue, which tends to view migration as a last resort undertaken only by the most vulnerable households. As another important insight, our fi ndings demonstrate important spatial variation, complicating attempts to generalize migration-environment fi ndings across spatial scales. In our rural South African study site, the positive association between migration and proximate resources is actually highly localized, varying from strongly positive in some villages to strongly negative in others. We explore the socio-demographic factors underlying this \"operational scale sensitivity\". The cross-scale methodologies applied here offer nuance unavailable within more commonly used global regression models, although also introducing complexity that complicates story-telling and inhibits generalizability.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': 'Scholarly understanding of human migration\\'s environmental dimensions has greatly advanced in the past several years, largely in response to public and policy dialogue about \"climate refugees\". As Gray and Bilsborrow (2013) have noted, the more public \"conventional narrative\" of millions of climate-driven international migrants misses the mark; most research places environmental drivers among a host of other forces shaping migration, with environmentally induced migration tending to cover shorter distances and remaining within national borders (e.g., Beine/Parsons 2015; Gray/Mueller 2012a/b). In this way, migration can be seen as an adaptive livelihood strategy used historically by human populations responding to environmental shifts (e.g., McLeman 2013a). Even so, given the rising political tensions surrounding migration, understanding its determinants is particularly timely.\\nThe research presented here on the migration-environment connection offers both new interpretations and a geographically refi ned and nuanced analytical approach. We examine temporary outmigration in the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance site in rural South Africa, especially as related to householdlevel availability of proximate natural resources. This \"natural capital\" is central to livelihoods in the region, both for sustenance and as input for market-bound products (e.g., Thondhlana et al. 2012). But beyond this paper\\'s overall examination of the migration-environment connection in this context, we also contrast the results across spatial scales demonstrating the importance of considering both regional and more localized patterns.\\nIn general, our results align with the \"environmental surplus\" hypothesis that contends temporary livelihood migration is more likely when households have relatively secure access to environmental assets such as natural resources or productive agricultural land. In this way, livelihood security may fuel temporary migration in pursuit of labor diversifi cation. This association contrasts with that of the \"environmental scarcity\" hypothesis which would alternatively contend that temporary migration occurs more often in times and places characterized by resource strain. In this way, our results counter the popular narrative of environmentally-induced migration by the most vulnerable households.\\nYet beyond our general results in support of an \"environmental surplus\" fueling temporary migration, our fi ndings also demonstrate that the association between environmental factors and outmigration is highly localized -in our study setting, the association varies across neighboring rural villages. We characterize this empirically as \"operational scale sensitivity\" since the process under examination \"operates\" at the household scale where temporary migration decisions are made, yet the statistical signifi cance of various predictors is sensitive to analytical scale (Maclaurin et al. 2015).\\nThe paper proceeds as follows. We fi rst offer an overview of recent research on the migration-environment connection, followed by the presentation of our specifi c research objectives. We next describe the rural South African research setting as well as our data and analytical approach. The results are presented in two phases -fi rst, the fi ndings of global models are reviewed which represent results of models estimating temporary migration for the Agincourt study site as a whole. This is followed by the presentation of the fi ndings when estimated for each village individually, including overall environmental effects on temporary migration as well as interactions which explore variation in these effects according to key household characteristics. We conclude with a discussion of the overall substantive contributions of the work along with a discussion of methodological implications of operational scale sensitivity. Overall, we argue that the methodological framework applied here offers more detailed insight than available through global regression models. Even so, the complexity introduced also complicates interpretation and inhibits generalizability regarding the environmental dimensions of temporary migration.',\n",
       "  'Environmental Dimensions of Migration': 'Population scholars have long explored the socioeconomic dimensions of migration, but the contemporary era of climate change has brought increasing research attention to migration\\'s environmental aspects (e.g., Hunter et al. 2015). A wide variety of empirical case studies have emerged offering important theoretical and methodological advancements (e.g., Aksakal/Schmidt 2015; Nawrotzki et al. 2015;Thiede et al. 2016). Also, recent research syntheses offer summary lessons (e.g. Hunter et al. 2015;McLeman 2013a), with most studies fi nding that environmental factors do indeed affect migration -although in different ways across settings and through interactions with economic, political, and cultural forces (e.g., Black et al. 2011).\\nAs the literature on migration-environment connections has emerged and become more sophisticated, theoretical perspectives have also become more refi ned. \"Maximalists\" argued that environmental factors exhibited a strong and direct causal link with migration. This perspective generally predicted millions of \"climate refugees\" (Myers 2002). In contrast, the \"minimalist\" perspective provided more nuance -with environmental factors interacting with political, economic, and cultural processes to shape migration patterns (e.g. Morrissey 2012; the \"maximalist\" vs. \"minimalist\" debate is outlined by Suhrke 1994). Migration theory, such as the New Economics of Labor Migration perspective (NELM), have proven useful in working through this debate. NELM argues that temporary migration in particular is often used by households as a strategy to diversify livelihoods by spreading risk through engagement in geographically distinct labor markets (Stark/Bloom 1985).\\nAlthough not developed explicitly for research on the environmental aspects of temporary migration, NELM has proven useful in examining migration, particularly for households in regions vulnerable to environmental strain and environmental change, since temporary migration can spread environmental risk through movement to areas with different risk profi les (e.g. Nawrotzki et al. 2015).\\nThe NELM introduces another important consideration in migration-environment research -the utility of a regional perspective. This argument has recently been made by Hillmann and colleagues (2015: 2) in a collection presenting the \"region\" as the \"place where the local, the national and the global scales meet\". The research presented here illustrates their emphasis on \"bottom up\" perspectives through its explicit consideration of spatial variation.\\nOther perspectives beyond migration theory have also proven useful in disentangling environmental effects, including the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF). The SLF outlines the variety of assets (i.e. \"capitals\") households have at their disposal for the development of livelihood strategies (e.g. temporary migration) intended to reach particular livelihood goals (e.g. food security). The assets include human, fi nancial, social, and physical capital, while SLA also integrates natural capital or elements of the local environment that households use toward livelihood goals (Scoones 1998(Scoones , 2009)). The central integration of natural capital into livelihood theory is especially useful when examining temporary migration strategies for natural resource-dependent households. Our research team has long made use of this framework in the Agincourt context (e.g. Hunter et al. 2007;Hunter et al. 2014;Leyk et al. 2012).\\nUsing these theoretical perspectives and a wide variety of environmental measures, quantitative migration-environment research has been undertaken in a wide variety of settings across the globe (Bilsborrow 2009). Examples of such measures include rainfall and temperature patterns (e.g., Gray/Wise 2016; Nawrotzki/DeWaard 2016), vegetation coverage (Hunter et al. 2014), and indicators of environmental extremes such as fl ooding (Gray/Mueller 2012a). In addition, qualitative case studies have examined the environmental dimensions of migration in \"hotspots\" including Egypt, Mozambique, and Vietnam (Warner 2011). Several methodological overviews have also been published, which offer, for example, descriptions of applications of survey research, use of secondary data, and different data sources used to refl ect environmental conditions and change (e.g., Fussell et al. 2014;Kniveton et al. 2008;McLeman 2013b;Piguet 2010).\\nAll in all, several key fi ndings are emerging from the myriad migration-environment studies undertaken over the past two decades. First, much environment-associated temporary migration is domestic, short-term, and often cyclical. In Burkina Faso, for example, rain-fed agriculture is a dominant livelihood strategy, although a south-north rainfall gradient, combined with poor soils, limits the long-term viability of agricultural livelihoods, particularly in the nation\\'s north. Residents of relatively dry regions are generally more likely to migrate, but short-term rainfall defi cits and harvest failures limit households\\' ability to invest in long-distance moves. Rather, short-distance, cyclical temporary migration is a common strategy in times of environmental stress (Henry et al. 2004). Similar fi ndings emerge in other settings, including several nations in South Asia (Bhatta/Aggarwal 2016). Such migration may be seen as aligned with the \"environmental scarcity\" hypothesis, which argues that households are more likely to engage in temporary migration as a strategy during environmentally stressful times. In Ghana, north-south migration has been linked to land scarcity in sending regions -another example of \"environmental scarcity,\" although regional structural differences in economic opportunities also act as an important pull factor for internal migrants (Van Geest 2011). Outside of Ghana, research reveals similar support for \"environmental scarcity\" in a number of settings as varied as Mexico (Nawrotzki et al. 2015), Bangladesh (Etzold et al. 2014) and Pakistan (Mueller et al. 2014).\\nSecond, longer-distance temporary migration, often (but not always) across international borders, tends to be associated with heightened resource availability, likely refl ecting the cost of such migration. This fi nding has been demonstrated in the research on Burkina Faso reviewed above, as well as in rural Ecuador, where land provides capital that can facilitate longer-term temporary migration (Gray 2010). Although such fi ndings are less common than \"environmental scarcity,\" they align with the \"environmental surplus\" hypothesis which argues that households are more likely to engage temporary migration as a livelihood diversifi cation strategy when acting from a foundation of relative security. A different pattern emerges in Mexico, however, where rainfall shortages predict international, but not internal, migration -although research suggests that this distinction is related to the existence of long-running migration networks between Mexico and the U.S. (Nawrotzki et al. 2016).\\nThird, several studies have illustrated gendered distinctions in the migrationenvironment association. Of course, migration -as a social process -is clearly a gendered phenomenon in general (Hunter/David 2011;Debnath 2015). In rural Ecuador, for instance, age and education tend to predict male temporary migration streams, but female streams are more likely to be permanent and associated with changes in family structure (i.e., marriage) (Barbieri/Carr 2005). Migration streams are also shaped by gendered norms regarding participation in agriculture, which is in turn linked to environmental factors. Again in rural Ecuador, access to agricultural land facilitates international migration for men, but not women -poor agricultural productivity tends to keep women at home (Gray 2010).\\nFourth, as with migration in general, a key factor shaping migration-environment linkages is the existence of migrant social networks (Nawrotzki et al. 2015). In Mexico, as noted, short-term rainfall defi cits are associated with international, temporary migration from rural villages, but only from regions with long-standing Mexico-U.S. migration networks (Hunter et al. 2013). Finally, while environmental factors play a discernible role in migration, particularly from rural regions, there are also close interactions with political, economic, and cultural forces that need to be taken into account (Black et al. 2011, and references therein).\\nThis informative collection of new research fi ndings could not have been possible without substantial methodological innovation. For example, migration-environment researchers have been quick to integrate advancements in multilevel modeling (e.g., Nawrotzki e al. 2012), and to explore the utility of approaches such as Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). In fact, some researchers have used ABM and sociodemographic correlates of migration to simulate streams as far forward as 2045 (Kniveton et al. 2012). Even so, spatial methodologies represent an important approach that remains under-represented in migration-environment scholarship. Such approaches are essential as migration-environment researchers aim to \"put people in place\" (Entwisle 2007: 687).\\nSpatially-refi ned analytical approaches are particularly relevant to this area of study because while political and economic forces clearly shape broader migration probabilities and directions, environmental infl uences and forces are likely even more strongly localized, especially in areas where residents are highly dependent on proximate resources. In our South African study setting, for example, villagers rely heavily on the productivity of bordering communal landscapes for fuelwood and sustenance. In such areas, regressions refl ecting average associations across the entire study setting may mask localized associations (e.g., Leyk et al. 2012). Such may be the case with a broad regional perspective as well and, as such, attention must be paid to the scale at which the processes under study operate.\\nThis concern can be situated more generally in the dialogue regarding global and local modeling approaches (e.g. Fotheringham 1997;Fotheringham/Brundson 1999;Leyk et al. 2012). Our models refl ecting all Agincourt households combined -the \"global models\" -seek to identify regularities across the setting as a whole. In contrast, village-scale estimates -the \"local models\" -demonstrate differences across space (Fotheringham 1997). The difference between global and local model results illustrate the impact of decisions regarding geographic scale -impacts related to the boundaries used to defi ne the importance of the location, as well as the size and extent of the population in question. We distinguish the geographic scale from the scale at which the processes under study actually unfold -the operational scale -and describe this as \"operational scale sensitivity\".\\nThe methodological concern demonstrated here is distinct from, but related to, both the ecological fallacy and the modifi able areal unit problem (MAUP). The ecological fallacy is well known among human ecology scholars, arising from making conclusions regarding individual or household-level processes based on the analysis of aggregate units (Robinson 1950;Waller/Gotway 2004). The interpretive leap is problematic due both to potential confounding effects not represented at the aggregate scale, as well as aggregation bias where model associations could shift and thus provide a very different picture of the process of interest (e.g., Greeland/ Morgenstern 1989). Similarly, the more geographic perspective on the ecological fallacy -called the modifi able areal unit problem (Openshaw 1983) -also takes into consideration that analyzing aggregate data can yield differing conclusions depending on the level of this aggregation. More specifi cally, the MAUP entails two subproblems: (1) the scale effect suggests that results will differ when analyzing the same data at different aggregation levels, and (2) the zoning effect suggests that the form or shape in which spatial analysis units are aggregated will produce different results (Wong 1995).\\nIn the migration context, recent research on the MAUP effect examines the performance of different predictive variables in models of varying aggregation. This concept -termed operational scale sensitivity (OSS) -provides a framework for the examination of how model associations change with increasing levels of aggregation (when the analytical scale departs from the operational scale which in the case of temporary migration decisions is often made at the household level) (Maclaurin et al. 2015).\\nWithin the analyses presented here, the analytical focus remains at the household level -the appropriate operational scale given that migration represents a household-level decision in the rural South African setting. Yet we alter the geo-graphic scale and thus the spatial extent or population size at which the models are estimated (Lam/Quattrochi 1992). Differences in household-level analysis results across different population sizes raise the issue of sensitivity where the explanatory power of certain variables depends on the spatial extent or population size for which the statistical relationship of interest is estimated.',\n",
       "  'Research Objectives': 'This project adds both nuance to substantive understanding of migration-environment connections while also emphasizing caution regarding generalization when analyzing this association. The recommended caution results from the distinctions between the outcomes of \"global\" and \"local\" models within our exploration of operational scale sensitivity.\\nOur specifi c objectives were to (1) identify the overall \"global\" association between temporary migration and proximate natural resource availability in our rural South African study site; (2) explore variation in this association across \"local\" models (i.e., for individual villages); and (3) identify household characteristics that differentially shape the migration-environment association at each geographic scale.',\n",
       "  'Research Setting': 'The study site -situated in the far northeast of South Africa -is that of the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System (Agincourt HDSS), operated by the Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt Unit) of the South African Medical Research Council (MRC) and University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) (Fig. 1). The 450 sq. km. area encompasses 31 villages, home to approximately 110,000 residents in 18,000 households. Since 1992, the Agincourt Unit has conducted an annual census, including the collection of migration information, in the entire Agincourt HDSS population.\\nA \"homeland\" area for black South Africans during the era of apartheid, the study site is characterized by high population densities (~170 persons per sq. km), high poverty, and a longstanding lack of development and access to state services. Two paved roads, one north-south and the other east-west, provide access to nearby mid-sized cities. The study site\\'s eastern border is fenced by private game reserves that themselves border world-renowned Kruger National Park, famous for wildlife tourism.\\nThe Agincourt study site\\'s settlement pattern is fairly typical of rural communities across South Africa, and socioeconomically it is characterized by a high reliance on remittances from the large proportion of adults who are migrant laborers on commercial farms and in towns and cities across the country. A substantial portion of households also depend heavily on the state pensions of elderly members (Collinson 2010).\\nThe area is generally dry (annual rainfall of 550-700 mm), although an east-west rainfall gradient shapes locally varying resource availability. Household plots are typically too small to fully support subsistence agriculture; some households farm assigned plots in the surrounding communal lands. Residents are typically quite dependent on the natural environment for a range of uses, including grazing livestock and collecting fuelwood, wild foods, thatching grass, construction timber, and other domestic products both for household consumption and for generating income (Shackleton/Shackleton 2000).',\n",
       "  'Data': 'In the South African context, a household can be loosely defi ned as \"a group of people living on the same property who eat from the same pot of food\" (Madhavan et al. 2009: 39). In many rural regions of developing areas, including the Agincourt study site, such households -which often include extended kinship networksact as the primary unit of production and consumption, reaching decisions regarding livelihood activities based on household needs. Migration represents one such livelihood decision. Indeed, in rural South Africa, migration decision-making occurs primarily at the household level, as opposed to representing a decision made solely by an individual (Cohen 2004;Collinson et al. 2006;Taylor 1999). As such, the household is our analytical unit, and all variables are aggregated to this level. In some cases, we use information about the household head as representative of the We use demographic data from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Agincourt HDSS) for the year 2007. For this year, the sample comprised 9,625 households located in 21 villages (see Fig. 2). 1 The Agincourt HDSS dataset includes geo-referenced location information for each household, allowing information about the availability of natural resources to be appended through a Geographical Information System (GIS). Details are given below.',\n",

       "  'Dependent Variable': 'A measure of temporary migration represents our dependent variable. Temporary migration is a well-established phenomenon with a long tradition in Agincourt (see Tollman et al. 1999), with 60 percent of men and 14 percent of women aged 30-49 years recorded as migrants each year (Collinson et al. 2006). In this way, the region can be said to have a \"culture of migration\" as has been identifi ed in Mexico (Kandel/Massey 2002). Our measure of temporary migration status is based on \"resident months,\" which record the amount of time each person is physically present in the household during the year preceding the census interview. In the Agincourt context, a temporary migrant is defi ned as a household member who is away for more than 6 months in that year but retains a livelihood connection (e.g. through remittances) to the sending household (Agincourt HDSS 2011; Collinson 2010). 2  We consider only the temporary migration of adults (age 15+), since we are interested in livelihood migration, which is predominantly labor-related. For modeling purposes, instead of dichotomizing the variable to represent migrant vs. nonmigrant households, we employ a count measure allowing for the maximum use of information available within the data, a common strategy in migration research (Bohara/Krieg 1996;Leyk et al. 2012). Descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1, demonstrating that across Agincourt, households had 1.2 temporary migrants on average in 2007, with a range of 0 to 12. 3',\n",
       "  'Independent Variables': '',\n",
       "  'Primary Predictor': 'The environmental data were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing imagery (http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov) provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and locally processed by the Institute for Soil, Climate and Water (ISCW) of South Africa\\'s Agricultural Research Council (ARC). Our primary predictor refl ects a satellite-derived index indicating the availability, and recent changes in the availability, of proximate natural resources. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of a number of commonly used indicators that enable the evaluation of environmental change\\'s impact on vegetation greenness (Roerink et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2003;   2 Agincourt HDSS employs a de jure household defi nition that retains links between temporary migrants and their rural household (Collinson 2010). 3 It is important to acknowledge that our analytical focus on temporary migration neglects considerations of permanent movement out of the Agincourt study area. In fact, our use of data from only the 2007 round of the Agincourt annual census precludes consideration of permanent migration of full households since they would not be observable. Even so, as noted, temporary migration, taken as a household livelihood decision, is a common phenomenon within this context (Collinson et al. 2006) and most aligns with research in other settings on the environmental correlates of migration processes and patterns. Zhou et al. 2003). Chlorophyll absorbs red light and the mesophyll tissues in plants scatter near infrared light; the NDVI is the difference between the values in the red and near-infrared spectral bands divided by the sum of these same values (Tucker 1979). This ratio has a theoretical range from -1 to 1, with negative values indicating senescent or dead vegetation. Positive values refl ect actively growing green vegetation. NDVI values saturate at high biomass (Huete et al. 2002), but preliminary fi eld work shows that Agincourt, which falls in a semiarid savanna region, does not contain areas with high enough biomass to approach this saturation point. Thus, NDVI can be used as an effective proxy for vegetation cover in this region. Tree biomass (e.g., fuelwood) and non-timber productivity (e.g., seed production, stem growth) are also positively correlated with NDVI (Foody et al. 2001; Mutanga/Skidmore 2004a/b; Wang et al. 2004). Therefore, this greenness proxy effectively maps the availability of natural resources used directly by Agincourt residents (fuelwood, wild foods). NDVI has also been successfully employed in livelihood-focused studies of the environment-migration association elsewhere in southern Africa (Nawrotzki et al. 2012).\\nWe created NDVI grids for the years 2005-2007 by calculating the annual NDVI mean of 16-day composites obtained from MODIS satellite imagery (250-meter resolution). To refl ect more general patterns of resource availability during this period, we take the average of these three grids at each pixel to produce a greenness grid. We then generated 2-kilometer buffers around each household, as this represents a maximum typical walking distance for natural resource collection in this region (cf. Fisher et al. 2011;Giannecchini et al. 2007). We excluded productive areas within village boundaries, since these are typically private homestead gardens unavailable for communal collection. To generate a single measure of available natural resources, we then calculated the sum of all pixels from the greenness grid outside the village boundaries and inside the 2-kilometer buffer for each household. The number of pixels representing communal land varies across households, thus the sum (rather than the mean) is calculated. This difference in pixels refl ects, in a substantive sense, the ease with which households can access communal lands. Households with fewer pixels within their 2-kilometer buffer will need to travel further for the same access as a household on a village edge and, therefore, with more communal landscape available within their 2-kilometer buffer. Finally, the measure was scaled to the range of NDVI. The \"NDVI mean\" variable represents our central measure of natural resource availability.\\nAs noted above, a clear west-east rainfall gradient shapes spatial variation in natural capital. Villages in the northwest are surrounded by communal lands with the densest vegetation cover -in Figure 2, see Xanthia and Agincourt (the village from which the study site took its name). However, the communal landscapes surrounding eastern villages receive less rainfall and therefore are less productive, while also experiencing higher collection pressures given the higher concentration of villages. ',\n",
       "  'Secondary Predictors (Control Variables)': 'A host of sociodemographic variables that are known determinants of migration (White/Lindstrom 2006) represent a variety of livelihood capitals and serve as controls. 4,5 Beyond being controls, however, these sociodemographic variables also serve as secondary predictors of substantive interest. We use interaction terms in statistical models to shed light on the types of households most likely to demonstrate signifi cant migration-environment connections at both global and local geographic scales. Additional detail is provided in the methods section below. Human capital. Arguably the most important measure of human capital is educational attainment (Saenz/Morales 2006), which generally exhibits a positive association with migration. To capture the overall household educational level, we include a per capita measure of years of schooling, considering only adult household members (age 15+).\\nA household\\'s stage in the life cycle also shapes the likelihood of migration (Nivalainen 2004; White/Lindstrom 2006) as well as the level and patterns of natural capital use (De Sherbinin et al. 2008;Vanwey et al. 2007). In line with previous research, we use the household head\\'s age to capture differences in life-cycle stage (Edmeades 2008;Carr et al. 2006). A third measure of human capital is elder dependency proportion: the percentage of adult household members age 65 and above. Elder dependency may shape migration probabilities in two ways: (1) by decreasing household potential to engage in the labor force (Juelich 2011) and ( 2) by enhancing fi nancial security through state-funded pensions, small but stable sources of income in South Africa (Collinson 2010).\\nResearch also frequently fi nds substantial gender differences in the environment-migration association (Henry et al. 2004; Gray 2010; Gray/Mueller 2012b). In Agincourt, males have a tradition of labor migration and are more likely to be the primary household breadwinners, but young women are increasingly migrating to pursue opportunities and gain freedom from traditional rural society (Collinson 2010). We incorporate two measures to examine gender effects: (1) a dichotomous 4 Within the Agincourt HDSS, different modules are fi elded annually, so that some information is collected only every second, third, or fourth year. Consequently, we use some data collected before our study year as proxies. For example, educational data collected in 2006 were used in the 2007 models, as was labor status information from 2004. 5 In preliminary analyses we included marital status and Mozambican background in the estimations. They are not, however, included in the fi nal presentation for the following reasons. Marital status was represented by a set of dummy variables (married 53 percent, divorced 12 percent, widowed 18 percent and missing 17 percent). Except for the missing category, there was no evidence for differences in temporary migration based on marital status. On ethnicity, during the 1990s, Agincourt experienced a high infl ux of refugees from neighboring Mozambique as a result of the 1983-1992 Mozambique civil war (Hargreaves et al. 2004;Madhavan et al. 2009). In our sample, 27 percent of households are headed by individuals of Mozambican background. Although citizenship was made available to refugees in 1996, this remains a marginalized population, as social and cultural barriers prevent equal access to resources (Collinson 2010). However, owing to a high level of segregation (two villages are composed almost entirely of households of Mozambican background), this variable lacks the necessary variation to be included. measure for the gender of the household head (1=female) (in Agincourt, poorer female-headed households send migrants as a means of escaping poverty; see Collinson 2010), and (2) a masculinity proportion, which captures the overall gender composition of adult household members.\\nFinally, an important factor shaping household human capital and livelihood strategies in the study area is prime age adult mortality due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic (e.g., Hunter et al. 2011). A dummy variable indicates whether the household experienced the death of an adult aged 15-49 in the past three years.\\nFinancial and physical capital. Classic migration frameworks stress the importance of income differentials, relative deprivation, and living conditions as important migration motivators (Massey et al. 1993). In Agincourt, these aspects of socioeconomic status, encompassing both fi nancial and physical livelihood capitals, are most usefully refl ected through an asset index (Agincourt HDSS 2011;Mberu 2006). As in rural regions of many developing areas, income is challenging to measure because there is a signifi cant informal economy and much employment is seasonal (Montgomery et al. 2000). To measure socioeconomic status (SES) more generally, the Agincourt HDSS collects data on fi ve categories of physical capital: modern assets (e.g., cell phones, refrigerators, televisions); livestock (e.g., cattle, goats, pigs); power supply (e.g., electricity, gas, fuelwood); water and sanitation (e.g., toilet type, private water supply); and dwelling structure (e.g., roof and fl oor material, number of rooms). 6 We anticipate a positive association between household temporary migration and SES, as has been shown in recent Agincourt-based scholarship (Collinson 2010). Better-off households can more likely afford the costs of migration and may have destination connections that facilitate relocation and/or employment. In turn, migrant remittances reinforce the higher socioeconomic status of migrantsending households (Taylor et al. 1996).\\nOf course, socioeconomic status is clearly associated with employment status, so we include a measure of the proportion of adult household members employed in 2007. Agincourt residents tend to be employed locally, primarily in the public sector (teaching, clerical work, or police work) or in the informal sector (selling fruit, cooked food, and snacks) (Collinson 2010). However, residents may also seek employment outside the study area, predominantly in the tourism sector (Binns/Nel 2002), agricultural production, or mining (Wilson 2001). Some of these opportunities require temporary migration, while others do not. 7 6 To construct the asset index, each variable was coded such that increasing values correspond to higher SES and are also effectively given equal weight through rescaling to comparable ranges. The asset values within a group were added and then rescaled to yield a group-specifi c value in the range 0 to 1. Finally, for each household, the fi ve group-specifi c scaled values were summed to yield an overall asset score whose values could range from 0 to 5 (Agincourt HDSS 2011). 7 As in most migration research, questions of endogeneity also arise because of potential correlation between outcome and predictor variables, although none of our predictors exceed a correlation of 0.21 with the household count of temporary outmigrants. Correlations with the count of temporary migrants that exceed 0.10 include those for asset index (0.19), average household education (0.21), and proportion male household members male (0.13), elderly, (-0.17), and in the labor force (0.10). Tests of the impact of specifi c predictors on the estimations suggest no substantial change in estimation results or errors.\\nNatural capital, recent change. Our central measure of natural capital, described above, refl ects mean natural resource availability for the three years (2005)(2006)(2007) before the migration outcome (2007). Since recent shifts in availability may confound the impact of this measure, we also include an indicator of recent change in natural resource availability. In general, the study site experienced a slight increase in \"greenness\" during 2005-2007. To account for spatial variation in this upward trend, we include a measure of \"NDVI slope\" as a control variable based on the same underlying greenness pixels used for calculating the average NDVI measure. For each pixel in the 2km buffer, the slope was computed by simply fi tting a regression line through the NDVI values of the three years.',\n",
       "  'Methods': 'The modeling process includes \"global\" estimates across the entire study site as well as \"local\" village-scale models, allowing for contrast across the estimated coeffi cients. We also focus on interaction terms, allowing the effect of all sociodemographic capital variables to vary by a household\\'s mean NDVI, 2005NDVI, -2007.',\n",
       "  'Global and Local Village-Scale Modeling': 'We compute Poisson Generalized Linear Models (GLM) (McCullagh/Nelder 1989) of temporary household migration using the full set of predictive variables: the primary environmental predictor variable (natural capital: NDVI mean), livelihood capital secondary predictors/controls (human, physical, and fi nancial capitals, and change in natural capital [slope]), and interactions between NDVI mean and the secondary predictors/controls. 8 The global model has the form where log() represents the link function, the natural logarithm, to transform the outcome variable η ij to linearity based on the set of secondary predictors, μ ij indicates the predicted counts of migrants in household i, and β 0 constitutes the intercept (mean log migrant count), while β 1-J are the regression coeffi cients of the central predictor variable (NDVI mean), secondary predictors/control variables, and interactions between the environmental predictor and secondary predictors X 1i to X Ji . Since households vary in size, a measure of per-capita migrants is a more objective way of representing the outcome variable than an absolute number. We therefore use household size φ i as an offset to convert the number of migrants in house-8 Poisson models have been successfully applied in a variety of models with count-dependent variables (e.g., Boyle/Flowerdew 1993;Congdon 1993;Leyk et al. 2012).\\n) ( ... ) ( ) / ( log 1 1 0 Ji J i i i i e i X X\\nhold i to the rate of migrants per household member.

At the local scale, we ran 21 village-scale models. Table 3 summarizes these village-scale results by simply indicating the number of positive and negative statistically signifi cant coeffi cient estimates across the 21 villages for the NDVI mean measure and each secondary predictor/control. To present specifi c coeffi cient estimates at the local scale, we chose four illustrative villages for the presentation of the GLM village-scale results as contrasted with the global model (Table 2). The chosen villages represent the west-east gradient of natural capital within communal lands. Finally, we mapped model coeffi cients (and their signifi cance levels) at the village scale to represent both the coeffi cients for NDVI mean (Fig. 3) and the most substantive and statistically signifi cant interaction terms between NDVI and the secondary predictors (Fig. 4).',\n",
       "  'Results': '',\n",
       "  'Global Model Estimates': 'A key fi nding is that, considering the Agincourt study site as a whole, the level of natural resource availability (2005)(2006)(2007) within a household\\'s 2km buffer is positively associated with temporary outmigration (2007) -offering support for the \"environmental surplus\" hypothesis. The estimated coeffi cient is statistically significant at the 0.01 level, net of the suite of secondary migration predictors within the models. The NDVI slope, 2005-2007, exhibits a positive association with temporary outmigration as well, suggesting that households with higher (and increasing) levels of natural capital are more likely to send temporary migrants. Virtually all of the secondary predictors obtain statistical signifi cance (with the exception of prime age mortality), no doubt partly due to the relatively large number of observations. In line with previous research, human capital and other forms of assets are important correlates of temporary migration. Households with relatively higher human capital in the form of overall higher education are more likely to have sent a temporary migrant, while such migration was less likely in households with lower levels of human capital in the form of more members of pension age. Temporary migration was also more common among households with more employed members, testifying to the importance of employment as a foundation for fueling migration as a further diversifi cation strategy. Recall that the pairwise correlation between household temporary migration and proportion employed is 0.01, lessening concerns of endogeneity between migration and employment measures. In addition, the fi ndings suggest that households with a larger proportion of male members and those with higher overall wealth levels/asset position are more likely to have sent a member elsewhere. At the global geographic scale, interactions are explored to offer insights on the types of households potentially able to tap into natural capital to fuel temporary migration -yet only two reach statistical signifi cance. The positive estimated effect of NDVI mean on temporary outmigration is magnifi ed for relatively old households as well as those with proportionately fewer men (likely because male members migrated). In this way, the results may suggest that natural capital enables migration by offering livelihood diversifi cation strategies particularly for households with higher levels of human capital in the form of age and male members.',\n",
       "  'Village-Scale Model Estimates': 'The Poisson GLM coeffi cient estimates by village suggest that the processes indicated by the global models operate quite differently at more local scales -which we suggest refl ects operational scale sensitivity. Table 3 summarizes village-scale results and illustrates that natural resource availability displays a range of effects, only some of which reach statistical signifi cance. Figure 3 maps the substantively and statistically strongest effects of NDVI mean by village; statistical signifi cance is represented by hatching. In two villages (Kildare A #11 and Kildare B #13), consistent with the global estimates, the coeffi cients refl ect a positive, statistically signifi cant association between temporary outmigration and natural resource availability, net of the control variables. Yet in two other villages, the opposite association emerges. In the villages of Agincourt (#2) and Newington (#4), a negative, temporary outmigration exhibits a negative, statistically signifi cant association with natural resource availability. Interestingly, these latter villages (in which lower levels of natural capital constrains migration) tend to have relatively high levels of resource availability in general and are on the study site\\'s northern edge, proximate to roads leading to slightly larger neighboring towns (e.g. Thulamahashe, ~11,000 residents). Here, the potential exists for households to make use of local natural resources as livelihood strategies while also tapping into the market and/or employment potential of nearby communities without necessarily engaging in migration. On the other hand, the villages in which NDVI facilitates migration (Kildare A and B) tend to be in the study site\\'s southeastern corner, more distant from larger neighboring towns and bounded by fenced game reserves. These villages have relatively low levels of resource availability in general while also being further from larger-scale markets and other employment opportunities. In this way, within these resource-poor contexts, households with relatively higher levels of proximate natural capital may be engaging those resources as well as temporary migration as livelihood strategies.\\nHowever, in 17 of the 21 villages (81 percent), the infl uence of natural resource availability on temporary migration did not reach statistical signifi cance net of the other included secondary predictors/controls (see Table 3) -a result quite different from the positive, statistically signifi cant effect of NDVI at the global scale. Overall, a far less consistent migration-environment narrative emerges when using village boundaries to defi ne study areas.\\nOn the secondary predictor/control variables, at the village scale the most consistent positive predictors of temporary outmigration include measures of human capital such as household proportion employed (signifi cant in 18 villages), level of education (signifi cant in 9 villages), and the male proportion (signifi cant in 8 villages). On the other hand, households with relatively more elderly members are consistently less likely to send temporary migrants (signifi cant in 6 villages). Household age composition, female headship, and mortality experience exhibit virtually no association with migration at the village scale (signifi cant in no more than 2 of the 21 villages).\\nInteraction terms at the village scale allow us to dive deeper into the mechanisms potentially underlying village-scale variation in the migration-environment association. Figure 4 maps the substantively and statistically strongest interactions with NDVI mean, by village. Statistical signifi cance is again represented by hatching.\\nThe lack of predictive power among NDVI interactions at the village-scale is notable. Among the eight sociodemographic variables combined with NDVI to predict temporary outmigration across the 21 included villages (21 * 8 = 168 interactions, not shown), only three (1.7 percent) reached statistical signifi cance, and no distinct patterns emerged.\\nHouseholds in Agincourt (Village #2) have relatively high access to natural resources and the probability of temporary outmigration exhibits a signifi cant positive interaction with the asset index (see Table 2). On the other hand, households in Rholane (village #15) have relatively low access to natural resources and they exhibit the same pattern -a signifi cant positive interaction between the asset index and NDVI as related to temporary outmigration (not shown). This interaction sug- gests that natural capital may fuel migration particularly for those households that already have diverse and stable livelihoods -even in natural resource-poor settings. Interestingly, households in Justicia B (village #17) exhibit a strong negative interaction between the proportion of elderly household members (the dependency measure), natural capital, and temporary outmigration. This village has particularly low levels of natural resources given its proximity to private, fenced game reserves. In this natural resource-poor village, monthly pensions, albeit low levels of income, may provide suffi cient security to constrain temporary migration. Another interpretation could relate to care-giving, as more elderly household members may suggest others have caregiving responsibilities, also constraining migration. The results for both the global and local scales offer multi-faceted contributions to the literature on migration-environment connections, particularly the literature on temporary migration as a livelihood strategy. In rural South Africa, we fi nd support for the \"environmental surplus\" hypothesis in that households experiencing less environmental stress or scarcity are more likely to send temporary migrants. Such fi ndings stand in contrast to the large fl ows of refugees converging upon Europe, who are often fl eeing from socio-political pressures potentially exacerbated by environmental scarcity. Yet an important distinction is relevant -most migrants from our rural South Africa study site are moving within South Africa and often doing so as a voluntary livelihood strategy. In contrast, the current refugee crisis faced by Europe is fueled by a complex mix of confl ict, impoverishment, desperation and environmental challenges -and such movement entails crossing international boundaries. Still, our fi nding of \"environmental surplus\" migration parallels prior work in Ecuador where migration was facilitated by more productive agricultural lands (Gray 2010). In rural South Africa, households rely heavily on natural resources for both daily sustenance as well as materials for products sold at market (e.g. Ofoegbu et al. 2016). In this way, access to natural capital may provide a safety net of sorts, from which livelihoods may be further diversifi ed -including through temporary migration. The safety net function of local resources has been demonstrated in other research in the Agincourt HDSS setting focused on household coping strategies in the face of adult mortality (Hunter et al. 2007).\\nOur results in support of the \"environmental surplus\" hypothesis are usefully considered within the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework in that natural capital intersects with human capital to shape the use of migration as a livelihood strategy. Importantly, however, the results also are distinct from those fi nding migration associated with the push of \"environmental scarcity\", as evidenced in settings such as Burkina Faso and Ghana (Henry et al. 2004;Van der Geest 2011).\\nOur global results of temporary migration linked with \"surplus\" contributes to the many empirical studies that have been added to the migration-environment literature over the past several years, fueled in part by public and policy concern with the potential for climate change to spur migration by increasing livelihood vulnerability. Indeed, some speculation has been made as to the European refugee crisis being, at least in part, related to climate pressures (e.g., Brzoska/Fröhlich 2016). Such concern certainly warrants intensifi ed scientifi c inquiry with the aim of ultimately generating conclusions about the connection between migration and environmental conditions/change. Even so, the research presented here also yields a cautionary tale.\\nThe coeffi cient estimates yielded from the analysis of all Agincourt HDSS households combined may not best refl ect the optimal geographic scale to investigate the household-level process under study. In this setting, migration is typically a household-level decision (Collinson et al. 2006). Furthermore, since 85.4 percent of Agincourt households do not own a car, it is likely that the opportunities and constraints within the local village setting may particularly infl uence livelihood strategies. As such, we tested differences in coeffi cient estimates across geographic scales to better understand how the migration-environment connection might differentially unfold if the study area is partitioned into individual administrative units.\\nDifferences do unfold. At the village scale, the models identify two villages in which households exhibit a particularly strong positive association between local natural capital and temporary outmigration -where households with higher levels of natural resources within a 2km buffer of the homestead were more likely to have sent a temporary migrant within the past year -a fi nding in line with the overall results from the global model. Even so, the local models also identifi ed two villages with the opposite association -where households with lower levels of natural resources were more likely to have sent a temporary migrant within the past year. Natural capital\\'s negative association with temporary outmigration is intensifi ed for households in resource-poor regions and with access to elderly pensions.\\nThe incongruent results across models fi t to different geographic scales (or geographic extents) leave researchers with a puzzle; and although we raise the question of operational scale sensitivity -we do not propose to have an answer yet. Unlike the ecological fallacy, the example presented here has retained the household as the analytical unit and it is, therefore, justifi able to interpret the coeffi cients as related to the household level. Unlike the modifi able area unit problem (MAUP), our models do not operate at aggregate units of different size and shape. Instead, we have simply shifted the boundaries of the study areas, focusing fi rst on all Agincourt HDSS households together (global) and then on distinct clusters of households as defi ned by village borders.\\nModels fi t to each individual village show high levels of predictive power (Leyk et al. 2012) and thus provide an objective picture of existing (or non-existing) relationships. The distinction between scales results from variation in the statistical distributions of incorporated variables due to the different boundaries and, therefore, different study populations. The global model masks associations that are apparent when using statistical distributions as defi ned by village scale boundaries, yet the village scale analyses do not allow for identifi cation of broader scale migration-environment associations that more generally characterize the entire Agincourt HDSS.\\nGiven this high scale sensitivity, the question remains: what represents a \"meaningful\" geographic scale to model migration-environment associations? We offer the unsatisfactory answer that \"it depends\". On the one hand, researchers often aim to identify overarching conclusions that represent broad patterns in migration-environment connections. In this case, the global model, covering a broader geographic region, offers an understanding of how this linkage operates at the scale of a small region. Yet, since households represent the locus of migration decision-making, village scale models may represent a more appropriate vantage point since these decisions are likely infl uenced by localized livelihood options (including availability of natural capital) especially given low levels of vehicle ownership. In addition, examination of goodness-of-fi t measures suggest the village-scale models offer better prediction of household-level migration as contrasted with the global, regional estimates (Leyk et al. 2012).\\nIn summary, our results suggest that, generally, natural resource security provides a foundation from which households may engage in temporary livelihood migration from rural South Africa. Even so, in some highly localized village settings, local scarcity also fuels temporary livelihood migration. Of central importance in future research will be the investigation of temporal variation in the migration-environment connection and, in particular, under conditions of more chronic and/or prevalent environmental change across the villages in rural South Africa\\'s Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance Site. tive, and computing support.

       "  'Introduction': \"The debate on the consequences of climate change increasingly focuses on the relationship between environmental change and human migration. While the empirical evidence for the link between climate-related environmental events and migration remains inconclusive (Black et al. 2011c: 435), it is in fact the case that policymakers, public institutions, and scholars often argue that climate change is expected to lead to migration due to extreme sudden weather events, such as stronger and more recurrent storms or floods as well as long-term, gradual events, such as droughts and rising sea levels (see also Foresight Migration Project 2011;Ja ¨ger et al. 2009;Laczko and Aghazarm 2009). For instance, according to the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2014: 16) report, ''[c]limate change is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement).'' 1  However-for the most part-estimates predicting environmental migration 2 to occur at a larger scale in the future have been widely criticized. The critique primarily stems from the overestimation of the number of environmental migrants due to two reasons. First, figures are usually based on the people exposed to increasing environmental risks, and not on the people actually expected to migrate. Second, these studies do not account for different levels of vulnerability to environmental change and potential adaptation strategies (Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;McLeman 2014;Gemenne 2011;Black et al. 2011a, c;Kniveton et al. 2008).\\nStill, there is anecdotal evidence, suggesting that weather variability may lead to migration flows. For example, in the 1930s, an estimated two-and-a-half million North Americans are said to have left the Great Plains because of droughts and dust storms (Reuveny 2007; see also McLeman 2006McLeman , 2014)); and in 2005, Hurricane Katrina resulted in one-and-a-half million people being displaced temporarily and about 500,000 permanently (McLeman 2014;Fussell et al. 2010). Unfortunately, such case-specific evidence does not allow for general conclusions with respect to whether and how environmental change actually affects migration. In addition, the environment-migration relationship may well be conditional on various individual, socioeconomic and political factors, which require a more generalizable empirical analysis than case-specific studies can provide (e.g., Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;McLeman 2014;Black, et al. 2011a, c).\\nThat said, there exists a large body of literature studying the impacts of the environment on internal and international migration using macro-level (e.g., Beine and Parsons 2015;Robalino et al. 2015;Marchiori et al. 2012;Black et al. 2011c;Feng et al. 2010;Saldan ˜a-Zorrilla and Sandberg 2009;Reuveny and Moore 2009;Myers et al. 2008) or micro-level (e.g., Kelley et al. 2015;Bohra-Mishraa et al. 2014;Mueller et al. 2014;Penning-Rowsell et al. 2013;Gray and Mueller 2012a, b;Dillon et al. 2011;Doevenspeck 2011;Massey et al. 2010;Gray 2009Gray , 2011;;Mortreux and Barnett 2009;Halliday 2006;Paul 2005;Henry et al. 2004) data and a diverse range of approaches, including quantitative methods, qualitative research, or both methods. 3 While these works offer intriguing insights into the complex relationship between environmental change and migration, their findings remain, as indicated above, inconclusive (Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;IPCC 2014;Obokata et al. 2014;Gray and Bilsborrow 2013;Black et al. 2011a, c;Raleigh et al. 2008). This empirical ambiguity may, on the one hand, stem from the lack of theoretical work and data, which induces that our knowledge on which individuals decide to migrate and which decide to stay-and why-remains limited. On the other hand, most studies focus only on one aspect of environmental change, such as flood, rainfall/temperature changes, or drought, and do not simultaneously examine the effects of different types of environmental change on migration in order to infer their unbiased individual effect on migration likelihood. In addition, previous research has not sufficiently addressed why environmental change causes migration in some regions or countries, but not in others (see also Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015, McLeman 2014, and Black et al. 2011a, c).\\nIn order to address these issues, our first contribution to the literature comes from developing a theoretical argument that links individual perceptions of different types of environmental change to individuals' decisions to migrate or stay. 4 To this end, and as elaborated thoroughly in the theoretical section below, we choose the term perceptions to express that we capture not only individuals' exposure to environmental change and, eventually, their willingness to migrate, but also their capability and opportunity to actually do so (see also Most and Starr 1989). Second, we focus on two types of environmental change that may affect migration: sudden and shortterm vs. slow-onset and long-term environmental events. As Black et al. (2011c: 437) emphasize such a distinction ''is useful in terms of both aiding understanding [environmental migration], as well as identifying key policy implications.'' Empirically, the corresponding arguments are analyzed with newly collected survey data, which comprise both individuals who migrated and individuals who decided to stay in five countries: Vietnam, Cambodia, Uganda, Nicaragua, and Peru. As indicated, a key strength of these new data is that we integrate individual environmental perceptions with other migration-relevant determinants at the individual and household levels to provide a more complete picture of the decision to migrate or stay (Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;Black et al. 2011c;Bardsley and Hugo 2010;Hunter 2005;Stark and Bloom 1985). In addition, the focus on environmental perceptions fills an empirical gap that was recently identified by Hunter et al. (2015: 13). We find that the effects of individual perceptions of and attitudes toward environmental change strongly depend on the nature of the environmental event: While long-term, gradual environmental events, such as drought or salinity, lower the likelihood of migration, sudden-onset environmental events, such as storms or floods, usually tend to increase it.\",\n",
       "  'What determines individual environmental migration decision?': \"While earlier studies on environmental migration draw on neo-Malthusian arguments, which claim that there is a direct and unidirectional impact of environmental change on migration, recent research is based on a more complex pattern of causality in which environmental, economic, political, social, and demographic factors are interrelated. Understanding these interrelationships facilitates disentangling the role that environmental factors play in population movements (Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;McLeman 2014;Black et al. 2011a, c;Piguet et al. 2011).\\nHowever, thus far, we lack a coherent theory of migration and face instead a fragmented set of approaches that are often segmented by disciplinary academic boundaries (Black et al. 2011a, c; see also Adger et al. 2015). For instance, neoclassical economists emphasize that potential migrants calculate their expected earnings in their place of origin in comparison with various destinations (Lilleør and Van den Broeck 2011;Harris and Todaro 1970;Todaro 1969). Or it is contended that migration decisions are taken by the household as a whole as part of its survival strategy, since migration of a household member is seen as a way for the household to minimize risks and maximize its chances of survival under conditions of economic uncertainty by diversifying its sources of income (Stark and Lucas 1988;Stark and Bloom 1985;Stark and Levhari 1982). Sociologists highlight migrant networks and a ''culture of migration'' (Kandel and Massey 2002;Massey 1990a), while political scientists primarily stress political instability and violence as driving migration (Raleigh 2011;Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006).\\nTo the extent that environmental factors are considered in these studies, they are regarded as either ''stressors'' or ''locational characteristics'' that influence the likelihood of migration (Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;Lilleør and Van den Broeck 2011;Knapp and Graves 1989;Speare 1974;Wolpert 1966). According to the ''stress-threshold'' model (Wolpert 1966; see also Bardsley and Hugo 2010), environmental events, such as floods or droughts, can act as ''stressors'' that affect individuals' life satisfaction. Not surprisingly, a growing number of studies demonstrate that disruptions in climatic and environmental conditions are associated with non-negligible changes in individuals' happiness and life satisfaction (e.g., Maddison and Rehdanz 2011;Luechinger and Raschky 2009;Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Gowdy 2007). Environmental stress should then be more important in areas prone to natural disasters and/or where people are directly dependent on the natural environment for their livelihood, e.g., when individuals depend on rain-fed agriculture.\\nWhen subscribing to the claim that environmental stressors affect personal income and the opportunity for future employment negatively, 5 thereby reducing life satisfaction, we argue that the individual might consider migration to places with better environmental attributes as a response. However, we submit that migration is not a ''default'' response to environmental change. Migration is costly, in both financial and sociological/psychological terms, since individuals tend to develop strong personal bonds with their home location over the course of their life (Adams and Adger 2013;Penning-Rowsell et al. 2013;Devine-Wright 2013;Lewicka 2011;Mortreux and Barnett 2009). Consequently, an individual will consider migration only when (1) environmental change has a major impact on her personal well-being, while (2) the individual's efforts to adapt to and/or mitigate this impact have failed or are likely to fail in the future (see also Penning-Rowsell et al. 2013;Bardsley and Hugo 2010;Speare 1974). If the environment has a major impact and adaptation is unlikely to succeed, 6 the costs of migration are lower than the costs of staying at a given location, and, hence, migration becomes an adaptation strategy to environmental change (Adger et al. 2015(Adger et al. , 2009;;Black et al. 2011;Bardsley and Hugo 2010).\\nIn line with other studies (e.g., Hunter et al. 2015;Black et al. 2011c), we emphasize that migration decisions are likely to be affected to a large degree by individual perceptions of environmental change, rather than environmental change identified objectively with ''scientific risk analysis, performed by experts, of system characteristics of the physical or social world'' (e.g., Dessai et al. 2004: 11). Environmental perception is the means by which individuals seek to understand their environment in order to arrive at a more effective response to environmental hazards. Environmental perception encompasses both direct experience of the environment and indirect information from other people, science, and the mass media, which are in turn mediated by individual values, roles, and attitudes. In this 5 Beegle et al. (2011), using micro-data from Tanzania, report that rainfall shocks increase the probability that people leave their villages. Similarly, Barrios et al. (2010) find that rainfall shortages raise rural outmigration in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lilleør and Van den Broeck (2011), on the other hand, provide a critical review of the existing theoretical and empirical research on how climate change and climate variability in less developed countries (LDCs) could affect migration via their effect on personal income. 6 Burke and Emerick (forthcoming) and Dell et al. (2014) provide evidence for limited adaptation among farmers. Unfortunately, our survey data lack a temporal dimension, and we thus cannot say much about the effectiveness of the adaptation strategies our survey respondents implemented. We can report, however, that almost all respondents implemented at least one adaptation measure after they had experienced the environmental event mentioned in their questionnaire. In addition, existing literature does, in fact, provide evidence that perceptions of climatic changes such as changes in temperature are associated with a higher probability to implement some type of adaptation strategy, for example, Gourdji et al. (2015) for Nicaragua; Di Falco and Veronesi (2013) for Ethiopia; Bryan et al. (2013) for Kenya; Below et al. (2012) for Tanzania; Seo et al. (2010) for South America; Chinvanno et al. (2008) for Vietnam.\\nsense, perceptions of (environmental) risk can act as a ''mediating factor'' between environmental change and migration (Bardsley and Hugo 2010;Hunter 2005;Dessai et al. 2004). And it is likely that perceptions of environmental change along with individual characteristics related to their (perceived) adaptive ability-and institutional opportunities and constraints-may be better able to explain why some people leave their homes when facing environmental threats, while others do not (Black et al. 2011c(Black et al. , 2013;;Mortreux and Barnett 2009).\\nEnvironmental change tends to have an asymmetric impact across the affected population, implying that while some individuals might be negatively affected by an environmental event-or at least perceive it that way-others could have a different perception of this. Research employing individual-level data on a sample of African farmers, for example, shows that higher annual temperatures are associated with positive net revenues for livestock owners, but negative net revenues for crop producers (CEEPA 2008). Furthermore, perceptions of environmental change are almost by definition relative, influenced by the ability of an individual to cope with and adapt to environmental change, i.e., willingness and opportunity aspects (see Most and Starr 1989). The range of adaptive options varies among individuals depending on attributes of the individual or her household, e.g., work skills, age, gender, education, or wealth. Piguet et al. (2011) and Black et al. (2011c), among others, argue that individuals who have access to resources are more likely to be able to adapt to the challenges of climatic change. Consequently, perceptions of environmental change are shaped not only by a respective individual's actual exposure to it, but also by her adaptive capacity, i.e., the possibilities and opportunities to cope with it (see also Grothmann and Patt 2005).\\nNext to placing individual-level perceptions of environmental change at the center of our theory and the empirical analysis, we further argue that the specific characteristics of environmental change affect the decision to migrate or stay. In terms of these characteristics, we focus on the distinction between sudden (shortterm) and slow-onset, gradual (long-term) environmental events (see also McLeman 2014;Black et al. 2011cBlack et al. , 2013;;Renaud et al. 2011). Sudden (short-term) environmental events, such as floods, storms, and hurricanes, can have severe impacts-at least in the short-run-on the well-being of individuals. These events cause casualties or injuries, property (e.g., houses, machinery, crops, etc.) damage, or social and economic disruption. Such events are likely to produce the greatest behavioral response, because they are above the perceptual threshold of direct human experience and are easily recognizable as extreme events with the potential to inflict a lot of (human and property) cost on individuals. Affected individuals may, thus, migrate in the aftermath of such environmental events, as the costs of migration are lower than the costs of staying at this location. The empirical implication of this is summarized in the following hypothesis 7 :\\n7 Migration in the presence of short and sudden environmental events tends to be over a relatively short distance, temporary, and internal (Hunter et al. 2015;Gray and Mueller 2012a, b;Black et al. 2011b, c;Myers et al. 2008;Raleigh et al. 2008). Due to the lack of a temporal dimension in our survey, we are unable to determine whether migration is temporary or permanent, though. That said, our sampling procedure of migrants ensures, to some extent, that migration is a more permanent phenomenon in our data. See the discussion on the sampling procedure below.\\nHypothesis 1 Perceptions of sudden (short-term) environmental events positively affect individuals' decisions to migrate.\\nIn contrast, slow-onset and long-term environmental events, e.g., droughts, desertification, or water/land salinity, even in the presence of short-term seasonal and/or annual variability, are not usually regarded as extreme enough to be significant, because they are likely to have a smaller (immediate) impact on individuals. Consequently, people will try to adjust their productive strategies over time when experiencing such environmental events. Individuals' responses include, for instance, investments in irrigation systems, the use of drought or water-resistant plant and animal varieties, or the diversification of income sources. Subscribing to the (anticipated) implementation of these strategies, this is likely to weaken the relationship between environmental change and migration. In addition, strong ties to the current location are likely to offset potential immediate motivations to migrate, and the personal characteristics of the individual are a major determinant as well. Hence, we expect:\\nHypothesis 2 Perceptions of slow-onset, long-term (gradual) environmental events are unlikely to positively affect individuals' decisions to migrate.\\nFinally, derived from the previous discussion and in light of the literature highlighting the importance of other levels of analysis (e.g., Adger et al. 2015;Hunter et al. 2015;McLeman 2014;Black et al. 2011b), the effect of environmental change on migration is likely to vary with country-level influences such as economic development as well as the political capacity of the government to effectively address environmental problems (Adger et al. 2009). Although individuals may be willing to respond to environmental changes by, for example, developing adaptation strategies, their ability to do so critically depends on the availability of the technological and economic resources for developing innovations. Consequently, to the extent that a state's economic development conditions individuals' migration decisions, we expect richer countries to be more likely to deal with and adapt to environmental problems, which in turn is associated with less environmental migration.\\nAdaptation and coping strategies are also a function of the political environment, which assists in promoting responses to environmental change. Relative to autocracies, democratic countries should experience less environmental migration as democratic leaders have the incentive to provide economic support, infrastructure, and social services to their citizenry for alleviating environmental hardship as a means to survive in office (e.g., Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). Thus, while individuals in different countries may be exposed to similar environmental events, the institutional and economic context in which environmental stress occurs may not only mitigate the hazard, but also influence individuals' perceptions of environmental risk. Eventually, we seek to examine a last hypothesis: Hypothesis 3 Economic development and a democratic form of government are likely to negatively affect individuals' decisions to migrate.\",\n",
       "  'Research design Survey overview': \"For a systematic analysis of whether environmental events influence individuals' decision to move, we require data for both migrants and non-migrants who originally come from the same area. Only when comparing individuals who have stayed in an affected area with those who have left, we can isolate the effect of environmental stressors on the decision to migrate, since comparing individuals from the same region ensures that the context for all individuals, non-migrants and migrants, is similar. Therefore, this research relies on original survey data specifically collected for this purpose that allow for a quantitative analysis of individual-level migration decisions. 8To this end, we conducted an individual-level survey in five countries: Vietnam, Cambodia, Uganda, Nicaragua, and Peru over 2013-2014. Our surveys yielded 3689 completed questionnaires in total of which about 50 % (N = 1854) stem from migrants. The five case study countries were chosen according to the following criteria: (1) countries have been regularly affected by weather-related events (storms, floods, droughts, etc.) and are also vulnerable to future climatic change (Kreft and Eckstein 2014;ND-GAIN 2013; EM-DAT/OFDA/CRED 2013; World Bank 2013); ( 2) countries come from different regions of the world (Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central and Latin America)9 ; and finally, (3) since our theory postulates different individual reactions to slow-onset/long-term vs. suddenonset/short-term environmental events, countries contain different regions experiencing these types of stressors in order to disentangle the effects of the two types of environmental events. Based on these criteria, we believe that our five sample countries provide an ideal testing ground for our theory.\\nBased on information obtained from the EM-DAT/OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database and archive research, we first identified relevant regions/ provinces in each survey country that are mainly characterized by one particular environmental stressor (classified either as slow-onset/long-term or sudden-onset/ short-term environmental event). 10 We then randomly chose the departments/ districts for the location of the survey. Table 4 in ''Appendix'' provides the locations of the surveys. Finally, we randomly selected communes or villages in these departments or districts by using a grid system with random starting points in which the interviews of the non-migrants took place.\\nIn contrast, a random sampling of migrants is hardly possible, since (by definition) they do not live in the same commune as the non-migrants any longer. Furthermore, in the locations they have migrated to, we do not know ex ante whether a specific person has migrated from the relevant areas. Hence, we relied on a ''chain-referral'' process (see also Laczko and Aghazarm 2009) to identify individuals who came from the exact same locations as the non-migrants, but who now live in the nearest major city, usually the provincial/regional capital and/or the national capital. Furthermore, potential migrant interviewees had to fulfill the following criteria: (1) They should have migrated out of the environmentally affected areas at age 18 or above; (2) they were not seasonal migrants; (3) they considered themselves as residents of this new location; and ( 4) their economic situation/livelihood was derived from this new location. Starting points of the chain referral were obtained by asking the non-migrant interviewees as well as the identified migrants in the cities whether they knew of any individuals who had left their commune or district after experiencing the same environmental event(s) and did not belong to the same household. In total, we sought to obtain the same number of migrants to match the non-migrants in each district.\\nAll interviews were personal interviews consisting of both closed and openended questions that lasted for about 30 min. We asked all individuals about their experience with the latest environmental event as well as certain personal information, such as age, profession, or education, as well as household-specific questions. The relevant parts of the questionnaire are listed in ''Appendix.''\",\n",
       "  'Operationalization of dependent variable and explanatory items': \"Migration, our dependent variable, receives the value 1 for those individuals who decided to migrate and 0 for those who decided to stay. 11 The distribution of this variable for each individual country is summarized in ''Appendix'': 1835 individuals in our sample are non-migrants, while 1854 migrants are included. Hence, our sample is basically balanced for the dependent variable. When designing and implementing the survey, we anticipated that it would be difficult to ask individuals about events in their past, as it is the case with any other similar project. Furthermore, the longer the time horizon into the past for which the respondents should provide answers, the more likely the problem of recall bias is. Recall bias, however, is unlikely to be a major issue in our case at least due to the following three reasons: First, the mentioned environmental event(s) should have such a great scope and thus importance that they should easily come to mind. Second, individuals in this first step had only to recall whether an event occurred and not when exactly the particular event occurred. Finally, respondents could name any event that occurred in the last five years which includes, of course, the recent past, which is extremely important to us and most likely should be remembered the best.\\nOur two main independent variables on perception of environmental change pertain to sudden/short-term and slow-onset/long-term events, respectively. For capturing this, we asked respondents-both migrants and non-migrants-to describe the main weather events they experienced over the past five years. Respondents could choose between several weather events such as heavy rain, storms and floods, or drought and salinity, but could also list any other weather event that was not listed in the questionnaire, or were able to state that no weather events have occurred in the recent past. If individuals mentioned that they experienced any heavy rain, storm, flood, hail/snow, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, and/or landslide/mudslide, we coded this event as sudden and short-term environmental event.\\nIn contrast, we coded salinity, drought, or desertification as slow-onset and gradual long-term environmental event.\\nWe also consider several control variables, taken from our survey, that are also included in other studies of individual-level migration decisions. First, there are respondents' gender and age, since women as well as older individuals are typically less likely to migrate (Hunter et al. 2015: 7f). Particularly controlling for gender addresses an empirical gap Hunter et al. (2015: 13) identify. Following recent explanatory models of migration networks emphasizing that migration decisions are made in a broader socioeconomic context, we also incorporate a binary variable on whether another household member has previously migrated. Such networks increase the likelihood that relatives and friends will follow once the first migrant has settled in her/his new location by sharply reducing the costs and risks associated with migration (Massey 1990b; see also Hunter et al. 2015).\\nTo control for potential economic reasons of migration, we rely on four different proxy variables, which we introduce into our models separately due to collinearity issues. First, we consider a respondent's level of education. Given that education can determine employment opportunities, it is often assumed that people with a low level of education tend to be more reliant on environment-dependent activities, such as agriculture, and are then more vulnerable to environmental changes; consequently, they should exhibit a higher propensity for migration (Van der Land and Hummel 2013). On the other hand, due to our sampling strategy, which mostly captures rural-to-urban migration, we might observe the opposite effect. Since urban areas are a more attractive destination for individuals with higher levels of education, these individuals could be more likely to migrate. We measure education via three dummy variables: Whether a respondent has no formal education, whether a respondent received at maximum primary education, or whether a respondent received at maximum secondary education. Individuals with higher education levels serve as the baseline category.\\nSecond, there is the interviewers' classification of the respondents' economic household status. While the ability to move is strongly related to wealth to the extent that under adverse environmental conditions wealthy people are generally more able to move (Black et al. 2013), the ''conventional narrative'' often advanced in public and policy debates posits that the poor and vulnerable are most likely to migrate in the face of environmental problems (Gray and Mueller 2012b), often leaving vulnerable women and children behind (Penning-Rowsell et al. 2013: s44). In light of this, interviewers classified whether a household is economically below average, at average, or above average. We constructed two dummy variables-below and above average-based on this information, while those individuals with an average economic status serve as the baseline category. 12Third, we use the respondents' self-assessment as to whether economic issues influenced their decision to migrate or not. In particular, all migrants were asked about their reasons to migrate and they could choose between, for example, social, political, environmental, or economic ones. For all respondents who stated that economic reasons contributed to their decision to migrate, we assigned the value of 1 to the variable Economic Reason (0 otherwise). Since we could not ask the nonmigrants the same question, we asked them whether they have ever thought about migrating from their location and, if so, which were the reasons for doing so. For those respondents who stated that they thought about migrating due to economic reasons, the Economic Reason also receives a value of 1 (0 otherwise). However, this self-assessment might be problematic, since individuals might want to overestimate or underestimate certain factors due to personal reasons (e.g., nonmigrants might not want to admit that they do not do well economically).\\nThe final variable to control for the opportunity costs of migration captures a respondent's profession as a proxy for economic well-being. The expectation here is that individuals, whose livelihood directly depends on the natural environment such as farmers, are more likely to move in the presence of adverse environmental conditions. We include the following five professions in our models, while individuals working in the agriculture sector are the baseline category: civil servants, individuals living from business sales, workers (industry, handicrafts, etc.), individuals with elementary professions such as day labor, and individuals living from remittances or other sources of income. 13\",\n",
       "  'Empirical findings': \"How do perceptions of and attitudes toward short-term and long-term environmental events affect individuals' decision to migrate? We analyze the pooled data of our five countries and rely on a multi-level regression framework that further allows us to control for influences beyond the individual level. This approach is likely to provide us with an overall assessment as to whether and how environmental events, on average, indeed increase migration.\\nWe use a random-intercept approach that accounts for the hierarchical sampling procedure within countries. As described above, we deliberately chose specific regions in each of the countries and then relied on random sampling below this level. Hence, we must control for the fact that certain sub-state (regional) or country-specific factors might affect our results. For example, Hunter et al. (2015: 5) point to influences stemming from ''a region's historical-political context.'' To this end, we incorporate a country-level as well as a regional-level intercept in each of the models in Table 1, which accounts for the specific hierarchical, two-level nature of the pooled data set (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2009). 14 Both intercepts are modeled according to a normal distribution (Gelman and Hill 2007). 15  The findings suggest that long-term, gradual environmental events, such as droughts or salinity, do not lead to migration; in fact, they even decrease the likelihood of it significantly. This finding is consistent with our theoretical argument that people are unlikely to migrate in response to longer-term environmental stressors, since they are tied to their location and, hence, adaptation might be the preferred option. It is worth noting that almost all of the survey respondents implemented at least one adaptation measure after having experienced a long-term environmental event. Adaptation strategies more often mentioned include substitute crop/switch animal type, change variety of crop, change sowing/planting dates, irrigate the land, sell assets, utilize moneylenders, and supply labor. In contrast, short-term, sudden-onset environmental events, such as storms or floods, raise the likelihood of migration. While we consistently obtain a positive coefficient estimate for sudden environmental events, note that it only reaches conventional levels of statistical significance in two out of the four models of Table 1. That is, when relying on the more subjective measures of economic motives of migration, i.e., interviewers' assessment of household type and individual self-assessment of economic reasons to migrate, the coefficient is not significant. A possible explanation for this result might be the high costs and uncertainties associated with moving, even temporarily.\\nAs the coefficients in the hierarchical models for binary variables we employ cannot be interpreted directly, we also calculated predicted probabilities for Migration = 1 and first differences for Sudden Events and Graduals Events, i.e., the change in the probability of migration when raising either environmental threat variable from 0 to 1 while holding all other variables constant at their observed values. Figures 1 and2 display these substantive effects. As Fig. 1 shows, the probability of migration is about 60 % in the presence of sudden events, while only about 48 % when individuals perceived the onset of a gradual environmental. Figure 2 presents the substantive impact in a more intuitive way: The first differences show that changing Gradual Events from 0 to 1 decreases the likelihood of migration by up to 10 percentage points. For Sudden Events, the first differences are mixed across the models in Table 1, which mirrors the insignificance in half of the models in that table. 14 Our results are robust across different specifications of the structure of the covariance matrix for the random effects, including when allowing all variances and covariances to be distinct. The findings also remain unchanged when employing a linear probability model (LPM) with regional fixed effects. We thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion. 15 One could further argue that migratory decisions are correlated within villages. To control for this possibility, we run models with bootstrapped standard errors clustered on villages. The main results of our analysis stay the same. Results are available upon request. The control variables are mostly in line with earlier studies (see, e.g., Hunter et al. 2015) and our expectations. While older individuals are less likely to migrate, respondents of which a household member has already migrated are more likely to move to a new location as well. This latter finding and its corresponding variable not only control for a household effect (Massey 1990a, b; see also Hunter et al. 2015), but also suggest that migration is a more permanent phenomenon in our sample. That is, given that migration by a household member is clearly associated with some costs, the decision of another household member to follow is likely to be undertaken only when the decision to migrate is permanent. In addition, the effect of gender highlights that women are actually more likely to migrate (see also Gray and Mueller 2012a). It thus seems that gender plays a complex role in the process of environmental migration (Hunter et al. 2015), but may be easily explained in our sample that focuses on rural-to-urban migration: Job opportunities for women are *** Significant at 1 %; ** significant at 5 %; * significant at 10 % Fig. 1 Probability of migration. Graph shows predicted probabilities for Migration = 1; horizontal bars pertain to 90 % confidence intervals; left panel captures probabilities for Sudden Event = 1, while right panel pertains to probabilities for Gradual Event = 1; all other variables held constant at their means; calculations are based on Table 1 and include both fixed and random effects more likely to exist in urban areas, which then lower the costs of the initial migration decision. 16  With regard to the economic reasons for migration, Model 1 suggests that individuals with lower levels of education than our baseline category (higher education) are less likely to migrate. This matches the interpretation that those individuals who most likely have better job opportunities due to their advanced education are more likely to look for these opportunities in a location other than their original place (see also Docquier et al. 2007;Beine et al. 2008). Given our sampling strategy, which mostly captures rural-to-urban migration, this finding might be more pronounced than in studies examining urban-to-urban or rural-torural migration. Similarly, Model 2 shows that individuals who are assessed to live in a wealthy household are more likely to migrate than individuals who come from an average-level household (baseline category), and individuals who are assessed to live in a poor household are less likely to move. The latter finding supports Black and Collyer's (2014) argument about ''trapped populations,'' i.e., populations that are vulnerable to environmental stress, but lack the resources to move. In Model 3, we rely on individual self-assessment on whether economic reasons are/were an Fig. 2 First differences. Graph shows changes in the probability of Migration = 1 when changing either Sudden Events (green bars) or Gradual Events (red bars) from 0 to 1, while holding all other variables at their observed values; calculations are based on Table 1 and include both fixed and random effects 16 Examining the results by country suggests that a positive and significant effect is only found in Nicaragua and Peru, while we observe a negative coefficient for the other countries (although only significantly different from 0 in Uganda). There is also little evidence that women following their husbands, i.e., dependent migration, can explain the positive effect of female migration. Hence, better job opportunities in cities are likely to be the driver behind women migration in Nicaragua and Peru.\\nimportant driver of migration. The effect of this variable strongly supports the idea that economic reasons are a major force behind individuals' decision to migrate. Finally, Model 4 stresses that individuals with a profession other than our baseline category (agriculture) are less likely to migrate. This result provides some support to the assertion that environmental stress is more likely to be felt by individuals who are directly dependent on the natural environment for their livelihood and, hence, the ones who are more likely to decide to move under adverse climatic conditions.\\nBy incorporating a country-level random intercept, we control for the fact that we study internal migration in five different country contexts. However, one could model these diverse circumstances more directly by including relevant factors that affect migration patterns within states. Two variables seem most relevant from this perspective: the political system and a country's economic development. Both items could influence a country's capability to react to environmental stressors and, thus, individuals' decision to stay or migrate. Our findings for this are summarized in Table 2, which mirrors Table 1, but we now include a variable on a country's political system, measured by the polity2 item from the Polity IV data (Marshall, Gurr, and Jaggers 2013), and GDP per capita in current US Dollars from the World Development Indicators. We use data from 2012 to ensure that both variables are measured before the surveys were conducted. The results in Table 2 show, however, that none of the country-level variables has a statistically significant effect on migration. 17  The lack of migratory responses to slow-onset events may be driven by a lack of perceptions of environmental changes, rather than adaptation strategies. 18 To address this possibility, we also examined with more ''objective data'' whether the impact differs in areas with higher variance in weather-related phenomena. For example, households in areas with high weather variance might recognize more easily climatic changes (Dell et al. 2014). We considered a variable on temperature variance based on ''NOAA's NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Monthly Means Dataset 1948-2011'' (in degrees Celsius) (Kalnay et al. 1996; see also Landis 2014) in two different ways. On the one hand, we examined whether this more ''objective'' variable influences respondents' perceptions of climatic events. On the other hand, we included this control as an additional explanatory variable in our models. We find that the more ''objective'' item does indeed influence subjective perceptions: Higher variances in temperature do indeed significantly increase the likelihood of respondents to perceive gradual events while it decreases the likelihood of 17 We do not explicitly examine interactive relationships between the determinants of migration at different levels, since Hunter et al. (2015: 9) describe these relationships as rather ''additive.'' However, preliminary analyses suggest no clear pattern between the political system and individual reactions to the type of environmental event. Since the low number of cases at the country level (five) implies that it is difficult to calculate models with multiplicative specifications, we divide our sample along the interacted variables. Hence, we run individual regression models by countries to better understand how democracy affects the decision to engage in environmental migration. We provide the corresponding results in the ''Appendix''. 18 We thank an anonymous reviewer for highlighting this issue. perceiving sudden events. Moreover, our core results hold when we include the temperature-variance variable in the model. Furthermore, Clarke (2005Clarke ( , 2009) ) shows that the inclusion of control variables can actually increase the bias instead of decreasing it. Table 3 then reports the results when dropping the control variables. Again, our finding that long-term environmental events are associated with a decreased likelihood, while short-term environmental events are associated with an increased likelihood of migration, is robust to the inclusion and exclusion of control variables. 19 \",\n",
       "  'Conclusion': \"Various academics, policymakers, and public institutions suggest that one major consequence of climate change is that environmental events force millions of people to migrate permanently or temporarily. Migration on such a massive scale could lead to additional adverse outcomes, such as social unrest and armed conflict (Bernauer et al. 2012;Laczko and Aghazarm 2009;Reuveny 2007). However, despite the recent empirical progress, important knowledge gaps still remain. We seek to contribute to the existing literature by developing a theoretical argument that considers individual perceptions of different types of environmental change and their likely effects on individuals' decision to migrate.\\nEmpirically, our research improves on existing work in at least four ways. First, we introduced new survey data from five different countries, which make our study one of the first relying on a quantitative and comparative perspective. Second, our survey allows us to distinguish between different types of environmental events. In particular, we considered both sudden-onset and long-term environmental problems for which we hypothesized different effects on migration. Third, our survey includes people who migrated and those who decided to stay, which is crucial for an understanding of whether environmental change does indeed lead to migration. Fourth, we not only include individual characteristics, but also explicitly consider household-level characteristics and country-level factors that should affect people's migration decision.\\nThe results show that the effect of individual-level perceptions of environmental change strongly depends on the nature of the environmental event: While suddenonset environmental events, such as storms or floods, tend to increase the likelihood of migration, long-term, gradual environmental events, such as salinity or droughts, are unlikely to lead to migration but in fact decrease its likelihood. This supports our theoretical argument that individuals prefer to stay and try to adapt to an environmental problem-instead of opting for the more uncertain and costly option of migration when facing long-term environmental shocks. Our study compliments the findings of previous studies, which report that short-term environmental events can lead to migration (e.g., Gray and Mueller 2012a; Paul and Routray 2010), while we additionally provide new evidence on the nexus between long-term environmental events and migration in the context of micro-level studies.\\nThe main policy implication of our research is that a more differentiated perspective on the issue of environmental migration is in need. Where future climatic changes manifested themselves in the form of abrupt and extreme environmental events, then large numbers of people might be forced to migrate from some areas of the world, particularly from low-altitude coastal areas in developing countries. However, if the past provides any insights into what may happen in the future, our work suggests that most people prefer to stay and deal with the environmental problem by implementing adaptation techniques, especially when faced with slow-onset, longer-term environmental events.\\nThat said, it still might be the case that some individuals stay not because they choose to, but rather because they are unable to move due to failed adaptation measures and subsequent depletion of resources (Black and Collyer 2014;Foresight Project 2011). Hence, future research should examine whether and to what extent long-term environmental events lead to effective adaptation and/or entrapment. Either way, improving the supply of aid to areas affected by environmental disasters, and the financial and technical support for adaptation to environmental problems could potentially be, at least in the short-run, the most effective policy options. \",\n",

       " 19: {'abstract': 'We analyse whether Tanzanian rural households engage in internal migration as a response to weather-related shocks. We hypothesise that, when exposed to such shocks and a consecutive crop yield reduction, rural households use migration as a risk management strategy. Our findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. However, this effect is significant only for households in the middle of wealth distribution, suggesting that the choice of migration as an adaptation strategy depends on initial endowment. What is more, the proposed mechanism applies to households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, but is not important for diversified livelihoods.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"There is a substantial evidence that climate has been changing in recent decades, both in terms of its means and extremes, and this trend will not only persist, but will intensify in the near future (IPCC, 2007). According to recent estimates, this unprecedented climate variability will first occur in the tropics and among low-income countries, where the projected mean climate may continuously move outside the bounds of historical variability already in 2034, about 17 years earlier than the global average (Mora et al., 2013). Through their implications for agricultural production, these changes will exert additional pressure on populations in developing countries, both because a majority of the poor rely on rain-fed agriculture and because the share of food in their budget may amount to two-thirds (Cranfield, Eales, Hertel, & Preckel, 2003). Therefore, climate change and climate variability should be perceived as an important source of risk for rural households in developing countries.\\nThe link between climate and agricultural productivity has been thoroughly analysed. Despite calibration caveats or data limitations, both crop growth simulation models and statistical studies reveal that whereas some yield gains are likely under global warming in temperate regions, the lowest income countries will experience the sharpest losses (Deryng, Sacks, Barford, & Ramankutty, 2011). In particular, cereals, the staple food in most of the developing world, show the greatest potential to be adversely affected by climate change (Schlenker & Roberts, 2009) and according to Schlenker and Lobell (2010), yields will decline by about 10 per cent by 2050 in nearly all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Schlenker and Roberts (2009) identified a threshold at 30°C for maize, after which additional increments to temperature result in a sharp reduction in yields. This type of nonlinearity can therefore have important consequences should the climate change lead to an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme heat events (Easterling et al., 2000).\\nEven though the implications of climate anomalies may have a much broader range than distortions of crop output, we focus our attention on weather variability as a risk factor in agriculture. In particular, we investigate the extent to which rural households engage in internal migration to ensure against agricultural weather-related risk.\\nThe literature suggests a range of mechanisms that households living in risky environments have developed to shield their consumption from risk, including income smoothing, self-insurance, and social insurance arrangements, particularly important in the absence of formal insurance or credit markets. Much emphasis has been put on households depleting their productive assets (Fafchamps, Udry, & Czukas, 1998;Kazianga & Udry, 2006), making low-risk, low-return investments (Rosenzweig & Binswanger, 1993), diversifying their income sources (Dercon, 1996) or diversifying landholdings into various spatially separated plots and into various crops (Townsend, 1994). However, these studies point towards limited effectiveness of risk-bearing institutions in protecting consumption against income shocks both over time and within local communities (Kazianga & Udry, 2006). The effectiveness of these risk-bearing institutions is hindered by the fact that weather risk is spatially covariant. Therefore, even though some of these mechanisms may be useful in case of idiosyncratic risk, they may not be effective when the whole village experiences the same climatic stress.\\nIn this context, we hypothesise that households exposed to increased weather risk may consider migration as spatial diversification of income. Since interhousehold family transfers are an important source of insurance in low-income countries, a household, as long as it can afford the cost of migration, may decide to relocate one or more members in order to reduce the correlation between origin and destination income shocks (Rosenzweig & Stark, 1989). Therefore, a better understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of migration as a risk management strategy may inform us about households' ability to adapt to weather-related risk, and, potentially, inform policy design in the context of increasing occurrence and intensity of climatic stress in developing countries.\\nA growing literature has investigated the use of migration as a response to climate change or climate variability. Starting with Rosenzweig and Stark's (1989) seminal paper on India, some evidence of environmentally induced migration has been found for both low-income (Ezra & Kiros, 2001;Findley, 1994;Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004;Meze-Hausken, 2000) and high-income countries (Feng, Krueger, & Oppenheimer, 2010;McLeman & Smit, 2006).\\nHowever, the environmentally induced migration is a highly contextual phenomenon, depending on particular agroecological conditions or cultural norms, as in the case of female migration (Curran & Rivero-Fuentes, 2003), and therefore different studies produce different, sometimes conflicting, results. For example, Gray and Bilsborrow (2013) emphasise the importance of international migration as a response to agricultural shocks in Ecuador, whereas Findley (1994) and Henry et al. (2004) suggest that in West Africa, migrants choose short-distance destinations. Similarly, both Findley (1994) and Henry et al. (2004) show that mobility takes place primarily within rural zones. On the other hand, Barrios, Bertinelli, and Strobl (2006) and Marchiori, Maystadt, and Schumacher (2012) propose a model where environmental factors lead to urban migration. Other inconsistencies occur with respect to the role of female migration (Findley, 1994;Gray & Mueller, 2011), the impact of natural disasters versus slow-onset climatic changes (Gray & Mueller, 2012;Halliday, 2006), or even sign of the relation between climatic factors and migration (see Black, Kniveton, & Schmidt-Verkerk, 2011;Feng et al., 2010;Munshi, 2003;for Mexico example).\\nWhat is more, a closer examination of the literature suggests that important data issues may be at stake. First, a great number of studies are based on surveys covering a very limited number of individuals, households, and communities, which significantly hinders statistical inference. Second, climatic data itself has not always been available nor reliable, and covers a limited time span in many developing countries, forcing researchers to base their estimations on merely a decade of observations, or on highly extrapolated data. Finally, many studies use rainfall data only, whereas the impact of temperature extremes is found to be much more detrimental to agriculture (Ahmed et al., 2011). Therefore, despite substantial progress in the field of environmental migration, the hybrid narrative of environmental migration requires further investigation.\\nIn this paper, we attempt to address these challenges in a number of ways. Our contribution to the existing literature is threefold. First of all, we employ standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as our principal measure of weather conditions, which is a big improvement over previous studies using temperature or rainfall data only. Recent studies (Vicente-Serrano, Beguería, & López-Moreno, 2010;Vicente-Serrano, Zouber, Lasanta, & Pueyo, 2012) reveal that this index tracks dry or wet conditions better than traditional indices like the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) or Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI); besides, by incorporating temperature and precipitation, it covers the whole range of the potential impacts of temperature, rainfall, and their interactions on crop output. To our knowledge, our paper is the second in the literature on environmental migration that uses SPEI (see Mueller, Gray, & Kosec, 2014). Besides, we base our estimations on high-quality household survey data on Tanzania, covering a large representative sample of households from the whole country. Second, Tanzania agroecological diversity, spanning from semiarid to humid areas, provides enough variation in weather conditions, which is necessary for statistical purposes. Finally, we propose a model in which adverse weather conditions, by reducing agricultural output, prompt households to send their members away in order to secure income sources. Our results suggest that a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural output instrumented with weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average.\",\n",
       "  'Background': 'Tanzania is a pertinent case study for the analysis of the link between weather, agricultural yields and human mobility. In a recent dataset prepared by the Center for Global Development (Wheeler, 2011), the country has been ranked 20th in the world in terms of the extreme weather vulnerability. 1 In the last decade, Tanzania registered two important drought events which led to severe losses in some regions whereas other parts of the country are subject to recurrent flooding. The aggregate indices thus hide important heterogeneity in terms of both current agroclimatic conditions, 2 but also future predictions of climate change impacts.\\nAn empirical analysis of rainfall and temperature suggests a trend of decreasing rainfall between 1922 and 2007, whereas temperature mean and extremes increased by 1.9 and 0.2°C respectively over that period (Mary & Majule, 2009). The same trend can be seen in our data. Several future projections using general circulation models indicate that the interior of the country will experience a 20 per cent decrease in rainfall in June-August season, shortening the rainy season and increasing the risk of drought, whereas precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50 per cent in eastern Tanzania and the Lake Victoria region (Hulme, Doherty, Ngara, New, & Lister, 2001). Temperatures are projected to increase by up to 2.2°C by 2100 (Agrawala et al., 2003). Climate change should therefore be considered an important challenge which Tanzanian households will be about to face in the near future. Even in the short run, they have already been exposed to altered weather patterns: erratic and poorly distributed rainfall, shorter and hotter growing season, and unpredictable start and end of the rainy season, with detrimental consequences for agricultural productivity (Kijazi & Reason, 2012).\\nTanzania, like many Sub-Saharan countries, seems to be particularly vulnerable to increased weather variability because of the role that agriculture plays in the economy and livelihoods: it accounts for about half of gross production, and employs about 80 per cent of the labour force (Thurlow & Wobst, 2003). Agriculture in Tanzania is primarily rain-fed, with only 2 per cent of arable land having irrigation facilities (FAO, 2009), making yields dependent on weather realisation. In a recent study, Rowhani, Lobell, Linderman, and Ramankutty (2011) predict that by 2050, the projected seasonal temperature increase by 2°C in Tanzania will reduce average maize, sorghum, and rice yields by 13, 8.8, and 7.6 per cent respectively. Ahmed et al. (2011) model a spillover effect that this decrease in crop yields will have on other sectors, and especially on food prices, leading to an increase in poverty headcount.\\nWeather shocks, agricultural production and migration 667',\n",
       "  'Data': \"We base our analysis on high quality household survey data. We use the Tanzania National Panel Survey (TZNPS) collected by the National Bureau of Tanzania as part of nationally representative living standard survey (WB's LSMS-ISA). The extensive focus of the survey on agriculture offers a wealth of data. TZNPS include a range of data on 16,709 individuals from 3,265 households. However, since our focus is on households involved in agricultural activities, we end up with a sample of 1,583 farm households for which we have full data. We conduct the analysis at the crosssectional level, using the first 2008/2009 wave as the baseline from which we take pre-migration household characteristics and agricultural production data. Since there is no explicit question on permanent migration in the dataset, the second wave of the survey serves to identify migrants.\\nFor the purpose of this study, we adopt the New Economics of Migration approach (Katz & Stark, 1986;Lucas & Stark, 1985;Stark & Bloom, 1985;Stark & Levhari, 1982) where migration is a collective and not an individual decision; household is therefore the unit of observation. Our dependent variable is a migration dummy for households which sent at least one migrant between the two waves. We identify such households by comparing the place of residence of all households members in the first and the second waves of the survey; thus migration dummy equals one for households with at least one member who permanently moved out of the original village between 2008/09 and 2010/11. 3 Despite the fact that we are interested in economically-driven migration, we do not restrict the sample to working-age individuals: the 2006 Integrated Labour Force Survey suggests that 32 per cent of children aged 5-17 years were employed in economic activities; and nearly half of children were engaged in households tasks. Our results remain unchanged when we exclude children from the analysis.\\nTZNPS provides a range of household characteristics which we use in our estimations (see table A1 in the Online Appendix for details): household labour, that is the number of household members in working age (15 to 64), dummy for female headed households, the highest level of education in the household in years of schooling, physical assetsthat is dwelling and other durables possessedcattle units, 4 and dummy for previous migration experience, which equals one if any household member had previously moved out or into the current location. Detailed agricultural data is also available; for the purpose of this study we use land area in acres and land characteristics such as terrain slope in the agricultural production equation. We use the data on distance to the district capital as a proxy of connectedness or cost of migration. The data on 2008/2009 income (total income and agricultural income) and value of crop production (all aggregates in thousands of Tanzanian shillings) come from the FAO Rural Income Generating Activities (RIGA) database. 5 The RIGA database covers all agricultural households from the TZNPS and all variables available in RIGA were computed based on the original TZNPS dataset. 6  Since the TZNPS provides the GPS coordinates of the households, 7 we are able to match the households from the survey with the corresponding weather data. In our analysis, we employ the SPEI index from the high-resolution (0.5x0.5 degree) gridded dataset by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010). SPEI is an index of deviations from the average water balance, that is precipitations minus potential evapotranspiration. The novelty lies in the fact that 'SPEI includes the role of temperature in drought severity by means of its influence on the atmospheric evaporation demand' (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010). Even though SPEI is oftentimes used as a drought index, we do not put any threshold to assign drought conditions; instead, we use the whole continuum of possible outcomes for both dry (negative values) and wet (positive values) conditions. We apply this measure to the growing season. Tanzania is characterised by both unimodal (November-April) and bimodal rainfall patterns (March-May and October-December); the hottest period occurs between November and February, and the coldest between May and August. In order to account for all these factors, we take the average value of SPEI index for months from January to June. 8 Since we don't know the distribution of households between the two rainfall regimes, we check our results using the average for March-May only, which corresponds to the long masika season in bimodal areas. Alternatively, we use monthly temperature and precipitation from a high-resolution 9 gridded dataset by the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (Harris, Jones, Osborn, & Lister, 2014). We employ them in levels (seasonal mean temperature and precipitation, and squared terms), but we also construct temperature and precipitation shocks, which we define as residual from the 30-year trend modelled with harmonic regression proposed by Helsel and Hirsch (2002).\\nTwo caveats related to the weather data we use have to be taken into account. First, both SPEI and CRU are gridded datasets obtained by means of extrapolation of the data available from meteorological stations. The availability and accuracy of such data in developing countries may be questionable. However, we only use the last 30 years of data, and, as documented in CRU, the number of stations, and therefore the quality of data, improved significantly over that period in comparison to previous years. 10  Second, the use of gridded data implies the possibility of a number of enumeration areas 11 having the same weather observations. In particular, this problem relates to Dar es Salaam. However, since we focus here on agricultural households only, the large majority of households from Dar es Salaam are excluded from our sample. Overall, we find from 1 to 32 households within the same grid cell; however, in 80 per cent of cases, a maximum of three enumeration areas (which corresponds to around 21-23 households) fall into the same cell. We correct this by applying cluster and Moulton correction options.\\n14 per cent of households sent at least one migrant between the two waves (table A1 in the Online Appendix). Even though this figure may seem to be low, and indeed, both quantitative and qualitative studies have documented reluctance towards migration in Tanzania (Beegle, De Werdt, & Dercon, 2011;Mary & Majule, 2009), note that in this study we measure migration flow, that is the proportion of households which sent at least one member away between 2008/2009 and 2010/2011. In particular, if we take into account that TZNPS is a representative survey for the whole country, it would suggest that almost three million people moved in Tanzania just within one year. Note that only 12 per cent of moves are explicitly related to marriage. Besides, as suggested by Rosenzweig and Stark (1989), environmental factors may also play a role in marriage migration decisions. In our dataset, we observe internal migration only. This is consistent with the migration patterns observed in a different household survey conducted in the Kagera region of Tanzania (Kagera Health and Development Survey) which shows that only nine out of 6,000 individuals tracked moved out of the country over the 10-year period. Some important differences can be observed between households with and without new migrants (Table 1). In particular, lower values of 6-and 12-month SPEI point towards more pronounced dry conditions that migrant-sending households experienced in 2008. According to our hypothesis, this is exactly what could have pushed them to relocate some of their members. These households are wealthier, both in terms of current income and assets, proxied by the total livestock units, which is not only a wealth indicator, but also constitutes an important productive asset in Sub-Saharan Africa. Much fewer households in this group are subsistence farmers. 12 Similarly, households who sent migrants are less financially constrained, since they have better access to credit and are more involved in informal assistance groups (SACCOS), even though these differences are not or are barely statistically significant. This may suggest that migration is costly, and that poor households cannot afford it. Finally, households that sent their members away differ significantly along the lines of traditional migration drivers: they are of bigger size and are better educated. On average, more households from this group already have previous migration experience, and the value of remittances they receive in the baseline year is higher than among households that did not send any migrants after 2008.\",\n",
       "  'Estimation Strategy': \"Our specification is motivated by the literature on the New Economics of Migration (Katz & Stark, 1986;Lucas & Stark, 1985;Stark & Bloom, 1985;Stark & Levhari, 1982). A central tenet of this approach is that families evolve economic strategies not only to maximise household earnings, as in Weather shocks, agricultural production and migration 669 Harris and Todaro's (1970) model, but also to minimise risk. In our model, which applies to agricultural households in developing countries, the principal source of risk is weather. Like in Feng et al. (2010), the main assumption here is that weather does not impact migration decisions directly, for example through its amenity value or through household preferences for a given climatic setting, and the results from the reduced-form probit regression of SPEI on migration decisions seem to support this hypothesis. In most cases, the coefficients of SPEI are insignificant, both in statistical as well as economic terms, with the only exception of 12-month SPEI significant at 10 per cent level (see table A2 in the Online Appendix). Instead, we posit that weather shocks affect mobility patterns solely through their detrimental impact on agricultural yields. Indeed, since income derived from farming activities constitutes a big share of total income, 13 a negative weather shock not only translates directly into the income shock, but may also have important implications for food security, in particular for subsistence farmers. 14 This, in turn, may prompt households to send some of their members away in order to diversify income sources.\\nOur empirical strategy, therefore, consists of two steps. First, we analyse weather as a risk factor in agriculture and we estimate crop production function. We use the value of agricultural production and not agricultural income since on the one hand, the output is directly affected by weather shocks while income is affected by the corresponding price dynamics in the local markets, and on the other, it allows us to minimise the measurement error associated with income computation based on recall data. We also focus on crop rather than livestock production because in our sample, this is the dominant farming activity: not only 95 per cent of households cultivate crops, but crop production also constitutes by far the largest part in total agricultural production with the median share amounting to 98 per cent. Besides, even though livestock production is certainly affected by climate change, the mechanisms of these changes may not be the same as in cases of plant growth. 15 We model crop production as in Equation (1):\\nY crop;ij ¼ f N ij ; L ij ; LS ij ; S ij ; Shock j À Á þ ij (1)\\nwhere logarithm of crop output is determined as a function of weather shock in a village j, and as a function of household i's number of labourers N ij , land units L ij , livestock units LS ij , and land slope S ij .\\nAs in a typical production function approach, the underlying assumption is that the adaptive capacities within agriculture are low. In the context of our study, this assumption seems to be justified given the short time span of our dataset which is not long enough to adapt productive technology. The observed level of potential adjustments to changing climate is negligible: only 2 per cent of plots are irrigated; fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, and improved seeds are used on 9 per cent of plots. With respect to technology employed, hand power is still dominant with 90 per cent of farmers using hand tools only, and with a mere 0.3 per cent of farmers resorting to mechanic power. As anywhere in the developing world, this may be explained by limited access to finance: only 6 per cent of households in our sample have access to formal credit, and only 5 per cent are involved in savings and credit cooperative organisations, SACCOS. 16  Second, we proceed to estimating migration probability. In light of the assumptions of the model discussed above, weather does not appear in the migration equation directly, but serves as an instrument for agricultural income that is the main explanatory variable in migration decisions. Thus, we apply an IV probit model where Equation ( 2) estimates the determinants of the household i in a village j sending at least one migrant M between 2008 and 2010:\\nM ij ¼ f Y crop;ij ; X ij ; C j À Á þ ε ij(2)\\nY crop;ij is the logarithm of crop production in 2008, one year prior to migration decision. The vector X refers to pre-migration household characteristics at the baseline (2008/2009), such as size of available household labour, gender of household head, the highest level of education within a household, livestock assets, and landholdings. We include these variables to reflect initial endowments that influence the decision to send migrants and are uncorrelated with climate fluctuations. C j denotes cost of migration, proxied by the distance from the village to a district capital. In order to account for the main mechanism in our model, but also to take into account the endogeneity in Equation ( 2), we instrument crop production with weather shock and land slope; the other production factors from Equation (1) appear directly as exogenous variables in Equation ( 2). Technically, therefore, by employing the IV probit method, we calculate the marginal contribution of weather shock, in the main specification proxied by SPEI, to crop production, and use this variable to explain migration decision within a household. One potential caveat in our approach is that weather may affect migration decision through channels other than crop production, such as livelihoods, animal production or off-farm labour productivity. If this is the case, then the assumptions of our model will be violated. However, in the estimation strategy we do not employ baseline climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, long-term means or coefficients of variation, that could be associated with many unobserved socio-ecological characteristics affecting migration propensity within local communities. Second, we conduct parallel analyses for livestock production and off-farm income (see table A4 in the Online Appendix for off-farm income regression), and the results point to the fact that even though weather anomalies have Weather shocks, agricultural production and migration 671 a direct impact on both livestock production and off-farm income, these are not the channels through which weather shocks affect migration propensity.\",\n",
       "  'Crop Production Function': \"First, we estimate the impact of weather shock on crop production as in Equation ( 1). As a starting point, we use SPEI at different timescales (1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months) as our principal weather variable. These timescales allow for identifying various types of drought that affect different usable water resources. 17 Recall that SPEI index is normalised with mean zero and standard deviation one, and that negative values indicate drought conditions. 18 Results in Table 2 confirm strong negative impact of drought conditions on crop production. The increase in water deficit by one standard deviation results in a crop production decline by 20 to 30 per cent according to different timescales. The magnitude of SPEI coefficient is thus very important, even if in practice, one standard deviation change in SPEI would entail an important shift in weather conditions; for example, in 2008, the values observed in our dataset ranged from -1.03 to 1.10 in the growing season. Interestingly, statistical significance of SPEI coefficients increases along timescales. This result becomes more apparent when we correct standard errors with cluster 19 and Moulton correction options in order to account for the fact that weather data we use is aggregated at the grid cell level, whereas our estimation is done at the household level. While coefficients for short time scales are not significant at all or are significant only at the 10 per cent level (for sake of brevity, results for short-time scales are not reported here), the results for longer time scales remain highly significant at the 1 or 5 per cent level, as in columns ( 6) to (8). This is consistent with Vicente-Serrano et al.'s (2012) findings, according to which vegetation in semiarid and subhumid areas, which are the focus of our study, tends to respond to drought at longer timescales. 'Vegetation of these regions is adapted to tolerate regular periods of water deficit and has physiological mechanisms to cope with these conditions' (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2012). Based on these findings, we choose to include longer timescale SPEI in our preferred specification (12-, 24-, and 48-month indices).\\nIn order to make a reference to previous studies, we also check the impact of weather on crop production using standard weather variables: temperature and precipitation. We draw on studies that use weather variables in levels (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, & Shaw, 1994) and weather shocks (Feng et al., 2010;Kelly, Kolstad, & Mitchell, 2005). Columns ( 4) and ( 9) in Table 2 present the results for temperature and temperature squared in the 2008 growing season and confirm the nonlinear inverted-U shape found in previous studies (Schlenker & Roberts, 2009). We also include precipitation and precipitation squared, 20 but they are not statistically significant. First, as explained by Rowhani et al. (2011), the CRU dataset overestimates rainfall in comparison to data obtained from meteorological stations, while temperature measures are much more consistent. Also, rainfall patterns show much greater spatial heterogeneity than temperature, and such heterogeneity is not fully captured by extrapolated data. Second, recent studies suggest that temperature extremes may be much more detrimental for plant growth than precipitations (Schlenker, Hanemann, & Fisher, 2006). Finally, in columns ( 5) to (10) we also test the impact of temperature and precipitation shocks on crop production. Despite the statistically significant coefficient for the temperature shock, it is worth noting that its magnitude is much smaller than those of SPEI coefficients. The impact of precipitation shock, again, is not significant. These results suggest that the range of weather conditions captured by SPEI is more pertinent to crop growth than a single weather factor.\",\n",
       "  'Migration': 'Table 3 displays the main results for migration IV probit model. For agricultural households, weather shocks appear to be an important migration driver through their impact on crop production. When we apply our preferred specification with long timescales SPEI indices as in columns (1) to ( 3), the results suggest that a 1 per cent decrease in crop production induced by a weather shock increases the \\n( Weather shocks, agricultural production and migration 673 probability of migration within the following year by 9 to almost 13 percentage points on average, 21  depending on the time-scale used. Not only the magnitude, but also the statistical significance of the main coefficient is highest when the weather shock is defined by the SPEI capturing water balance conditions during 12 months. We find the significant impact of crop output deviations on migration decision when we use temperature and precipitation and the squared terms as in column ( 4), and deviation from the trend as in column (5) as well. Findings in column ( 4) should be treated with caution, however, since the results for the temperature and precipitation in levels in the agricultural production equation are not robust to different specifications (Table 2). The estimates in Table 3 confirm the importance of traditional migration drivers: labour force availability, education level and previous migration experience increase the probability of migration, but the magnitude of this impact is much smaller than that of crop production shock. Surprisingly, the effect of the distance to the district capital is almost negligible. On the other hand, as expected, the initial endowment, proxied here by the total livestock units of cattle, turns out to be a significant factor in migration process.\\nTaking into account the role that initial endowments may play in migration, especially in the context of low income and important financial constraints, we explore this issue in detail in Table 4. We divide our sample into three wealth categories and conduct separate estimations for each of them. We apply two measures of wealth: an asset-based wealth index which we constructed by applying Kolenikov and Angeles (2004) polychoric principal component analysis as in columns (1) to ( 3), and expenditures per capita. 22 Independent of the wealth measure used, the results show an interesting pattern: weather-induced crop output shock is an important predictor of migration probability only for households in the middle of the wealth distribution, whereas it is insignificant for the poorest and the richest households. We may expect that the poorest households cannot afford migration costs, while the richest ones may prefer and also afford in-situ adaptation strategies, such as irrigation or droughtresistant crops.

Maurel Finally, in order to test the validity of the agricultural productivity mechanism in our model, we estimate Equation ( 2) separately for households specialised in agriculture, which we define as those households that derive at least 75 per cent of their income from agriculture, and diversified households. The results in columns ( 4) and (5) confirm our expectations. Weather-induced negative crop output shocks play a much more important role for households dependent on agriculture: the coefficient in column ( 4) is more than twice as high than in column (5), both in terms of its magnitude and statistical significance. A similar pattern is observed when we use temperature and precipitation shocks as instruments for crop output, 23 even though the coefficients and their statistical significance are lower, consistent with the previous results. This clearly suggests that farmers specialised in agriculture, who constitute about half of our sample, are the most vulnerable to the impact of deviations in weather patterns.',\n",
       "  'Robustness': 'As a robustness check, we employ a set of estimations using a constrained definition of dependent variable, as well as alternative measures of the main explanatory variable (Table 5). In column (1), we recall our principal results. In column (2), we estimate our model for migrants defined as those individuals who moved a distance greater than 10 km. With this threshold, we exclude very short-distance moves within or in the vicinity of the village of origin. In column (3), we include only individuals of working age (15-year old and older) in order to put emphasis on the economic motivations of migration. For the sake of brevity, we present results only for crop production instrumented with 12-month SPEI. Finally, in columns ( 4) to ( 6), we instrument crop output with SPEI measured uniquely for the long masika season, the most important growing season in regions characterised by bi-modal rainfall patterns.

The magnitude of the coefficients moves only slightly, while their statistical significance remains high at 1 per cent.\\nFinally, we conduct the attrition analysis (see the Online Appendix). Even though low in comparison to most longitudinal surveys (4.5% of individuals from our target sample), the attrition observed in the TZNPS may potentially constitute a serious problem for the analysis of migration. Since residential moves are typically one of the main reasons for non-response in panel surveys (Fitzgerald, Gottschalk, & Moffitt, 1998), it is plausible that attrition in our dataset is not random but instead is systematically associated with the covariates explaining migration decisions. If this were the case, then our estimates based on a sample of non-attritors would be biased. However, we show that despite being non-random, the attrition observed in the sample does not consistently bias our results. The only caveat is that by conducting the analysis based on the sample of non-attritors, we may potentially underestimate the magnitude of our findings.',\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'We investigate whether Tanzanian households respond to weather risk. We test an IV probit model where migration decision is determined by agricultural income instrumented with standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), but also temperature and precipitation shocks. Our results suggest that weather shocks have a significant negative impact on crop production. As a consequence, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. Interestingly, migration decision appears to be conditional on initial endowment, since only households in the middle of the wealth distribution respond to the weather shock by spatially diversifying their income sources. What is more, such a mechanism where climate variability affects household migration decision through agricultural channel is valid only for households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, while the results are not significant for diversified livelihoods.\\nTo our knowledge, this study is the second to use SPEI index in the literature on environmental migration. Our results showed some important advantages of this multi-scalar index over different measures of temperature and precipitation. SPEI encompasses the whole spectrum of water balance, including the effects of temperature, and is therefore better suited to capture meteorological conditions that have an impact on plant growth and agricultural output.'},\n",
       " 20: {'abstract': 'Migration-environment models tend to be aspatial within chosen study regions, although associations between temporary outmigration and environmental explanatory variables likely vary across the study space. This research extends current approaches by developing migration models considering spatial non-stationarity and temporal variation e through examination of the migration-environment association at nested geographic scales (i.e. whole-population, village, and subvillage) within a specific study site. Demographic survey data from rural South Africa, combined with indicators of natural resource availability from satellite imagery, are employed in a nested modeling approach that brings out distinct patterns of spatial variation in model associations derived at finer geographic scales.

       "  'Introduction': \"Fueled by recognition of the world's changing climate (IPCC, 2007(IPCC, , 2012)), the past several years have seen burgeoning academic interest in the environmental dimensions of human migration. The connection is logical, particularly in rural regions where daily lives are dependent on proximate natural resources, since environmental change portends dramatic shifts in livelihood options. In the face of livelihood decline, migration can be seen as an adaptive strategy (McLeman & Hunter, 2010) and, therefore, methodological advancements in the study of migrationenvironment associations are particularly timely.\\nThis paper offers substantial methodological advancement in this context through systematic examination of the robustness of migration-environment associations across different spatial scales (whole-population, village, and subvillage). Since migrationenvironment associations are expected to vary under different socio-ecological conditions, models not accounting for such variations (i.e. 'global' statistical models) are limited in that they provide only an averaged estimation of this association across a predefined space. How to methodologically assess the robustness of such associations across different scales, and to explore the effects of inherent spatial variation of such associations with statistical rigor, remain open questions. We explore these questions here.\",\n",
       "  'Environmental dependence in rural regions': 'Recent studies document widespread use of natural resources and natural resource-based products in rural regions across the globe. Millions of households make direct use of wild resources for dietary and other household uses (Crookes, 2003), while some engage in direct trade of collected products such as fruit, mushrooms, worms (e.g. Wynberg et al., 2003). Resource-based craft trades are also common, for example producing and selling twig brooms and reed mats, represent important livelihood strategies in parts of rural South Africa (Botha, Witkowski, & Shackleton, 2004;Gyan & Shackleton, 2005;Shackleton, Campbell, Lotz-Sisitka, & Shackleton, 2008). Although cash returns to resource-based livelihoods are often quite low, many households devote time and energy to these activities to enhance livelihood security and lessen the need to seek demoralizing, insecure casual labor (Shackleton & Shackleton, 2011).\\nProximate natural resources also often serve as \"safety nets\" for vulnerable rural households in less developed settings (Hunter, Twine, & Johnson, 2011;McSweeny, 2004). A recent study in rural South Africa found that, in the wake of a shock such as job loss or mortality, a majority of households increased use of locallycollected resources such as wild foods, fuelwood and medicinal plants (Paumgarten & Shackleton, 2011). In the wake of environmental change, the availability and variability of such natural \"safety nets\" may shift and households may adapt alternative strategies such as migration.',\n",
       "  'Migration as adaptation': \"Human migration as an adaptive strategy is certainly nothing new, and historical analogs, such as investigation of migration from the Great Plains' Dust Bowl, have informed recent understandings of migration potential (McLeman & Smit, 2006). Yet, what is new is the sheer number of households potentially impacted by contemporary environmental change, the magnitude of vulnerability due to widespread impoverishment, and the security concerns being articulated by policymakers and the public (Scheffran & Battaglini, 2011). Further, recent methodological advancements have provided the basis for improved scientific examination of the migrationenvironment association.\\nAspatial empirical models have taken two key forms. First, aggregated data (such as information at the state, county or village levels) are used as units of analysis in order to estimate associations between migration rates and relevant socio-economic and environmental characteristics (e.g. Feng, Krueger, & Oppenheimer, 2010;Hunter, 1998Hunter, , 2000)). Within such models, environmental factors are included as general spatially undifferentiated measures. As a logical consequence, spatial dependence and clustering effects are rarely considered, and variation in the migration-environment association within the broader study region is not explored. Second, individualand household level predictive models of migration have been extended to add environmental measures to the set of typical crosssectional predictors at the individual-level such as gender, age, and education, or at the household level, such as size and compositional indicators (Findley, 1994;Meze-Hausken, 2000). Within these 'global' statistical approaches, factors such as estimated (regional) rainfall or general undifferentiated measures of natural resource availability can represent local or even regional environmental pressures at a particular point in time, or they can be used to analyze change within a recent temporal window (e.g., Gray, 2009;Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004). As a consequence, results tend to reveal that environmental factors act in concert with other migration pressures and thus differential effects within the study region, net of incorporated controls, cannot be estimated.\",\n",
       "  'Needs in modeling migration-environment associations': \"Within the past several years, models of the migrationenvironment association in resource-dependent regions have become increasingly sophisticated through the use of, for example, longitudinal and/or multi-level models. These often integrate random effects (e.g., Barbieri & Carr, 2005;Gray, 2011;Henry et al., 2004;Yabiku, Glick, Wentz, Haas, & Zhu, 2009) and have, therefore, advanced inclusion of general spatial effects. However, rarely has spatial variation in the migration-environment association itself nor the role of scale in the modeling approach been the content of substantive query. Exploring spatial variation raises two important connotations of scale. Geographic scale refers to the spatial extent within which the phenomenon or association is being studied (Lam & Quattrochi, 1992), and analysis scale (or resolution) refers to the size of the units at which observations were recorded or aggregated (Montello, 2001). In this study we vary the geographic scale used for modeling (i.e. the population size, or n, in the statistical model) while holding the analysis scale (i.e. the household unit) fixed. This approach allows to explore how associations (regression coefficients) change at different spatial extents of analysis (whole-population, village and subvillage). We argue that much can be learned from how migration propensity varies with changing geographic scale of the modeling approach.\\nAlthough methods to investigate spatial non-stationarity are routinely employed in the field of geography, migration-environment connections have not been studied in this context. These existing approaches usually rely on local estimations such as varying coefficient models (Cleveland, Grosse, & Shyu, 1991;Hastie & Tibshirani, 1993) or geographically weighted regression (GWR) models (Brunsdon, Fotheringham, & Charlton, 1996;Fotheringham, Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2002) which have significant limitations that result in a lack in robustness for statistical inference (O'Sullivan & Unwin, 2010). For instance, models can suffer from local over-fitting as a result of reduced degrees of freedom and the spatial weighting of observations in each local regression can lead to patterns of induced spatial heterogeneity (Cho, Lambert, & Chen, 2010). Furthermore, the instability of coefficient estimates as a function of bandwidth (Farber & Páez, 2007) and multicollinearity of the local coefficient estimates have been identified as serious hindrances with the GWR method (Griffith, 2008;Wheeler, 2007). For modeling Poisson distributed migration data, local estimation models have not been readily extended into a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework. In order to improve our ability to understand existing associations between migration and environmental factors on the household level and thus improve program and policy recommendations, these limitations must be addressed. Particularly, the sensitivity of statistical models to changes in geographic scale and the variation of target associations across space (non-stationarity) have to be evaluated. Identifying subregions experiencing heightened vulnerability to environmental change could greatly enhance targeted interventions.\\nThis research taps into the potential of spatially explicit demographic surveillance data from a remote rural region of South Africa, combined with indicators of both spatial and temporal variation in natural resource availability across the study site. We make use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from MODIS remote sensing imagery as an indicator of natural resource availability and variability.\\nAn analytical framework is developed that overcomes the above limitations by using traditional regression approaches on nested geographic scales generated by random simulation (spatial permutation). This allows for:\\n(i) comparison of models across (nested) geographic scales (i.e., whole-population, village and subvillage scales) in order to systematically examine the sensitivity of the migrationenvironment association to changing (sub)populations used for modeling; (ii) investigation of the spatial non-stationarity of migrationenvironment associations estimated on a set of subpopulations (i.e. villages) at the same geographic scale within the study site. In contrast to common local estimators, each model association is estimated from an entire subpopulation and has sufficient statistical rigor without induced effects of over-fitting or multicollinearity; (iii) comparison of models for two different points in time (2002 and 2007) in order to estimate the effect of changing environmental conditions on the migration-environment models.\",\n",
       "  'Data and data processing': 'The Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (AHDSS) site is located in a rural region of northeastern South Africa (Fig. 1).1 Since 1992, the AHDSS has conducted an annual census, today encompassing 24 villages including approximately 84,000 residents and 14,000 households. The area is characterized by high population densities, high levels of poverty and long standing lack of development and access to state services.\\nOur dataset consists of 9374 households that were sampled in both 2002 and 2007 from the 21 villages. The latitude and longitude of each household has been recorded in the dataset, and thus provides the unique opportunity to undertake spatial analyses at the household level.\\nOur response variable is the number of temporary migrants, older than 15 years, at the household level. A temporary migrant is defined as a person leaving a household with a temporary intention and spending at least six months of a year away from home, although still linked to the rural household. As an independent variable, we employ an additive index of household socio-economic status (SES) that combines measures of modern assets, livestock assets and information about power supply, access to water and sanitation, and dwelling structure. Household SES was identified as an important explanatory variable for migration in our preliminary analysis as well as in recent research (e.g., Mberu, 2006).\\nIn order to incorporate an environmental independent variable, we use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to calculate a greenness metric as a surrogate for natural resource availability at the household level (Fig. 2). NDVI has been used to monitor plant growth (vigor), density of vegetation cover and biomass production (Foody et al., 2001;Wang, Rich, Price, & Kettle, 2004) and is therefore an effective indicator of the natural resources locally used in livelihood strategies (e.g. firewood, seeds, wild foods, fencing materials, etc.).\\nYearly NDVI values were calculated by taking the annual mean of 16-day composites from MODIS satellite imagery (250 m resolution). We took the mean of the year of analysis and the two years prior to create greenness grids for 2002 and 2007 (Fig. 2a). By including the two years prior to the outcome years, we take into account the availability of natural resources leading up to 2002 and 2007.\\nThe first time period is characterized by relatively high but slightly decreasing greenness values from 2000 to 2002 (NDVI between 0.55 and 0.49 on average); the latter period shows similar mean greenness but higher variation across the years with an increasing trend from 2005 to 2007 (NDVI between 0.45 and 0.53). Thus, on average, mean greenness values were similar in both time periods with some visible differences in the spatial distributions due to different resource availability \"histories\". Investigation into the effect of refined temporal trends in resource availability will be left to future research.\\nFrom the two greenness grids, areas within village boundaries were excluded since these are not communal lands and are therefore not used for resource collection. We next created 2000 m buffer zones around each household (top panel inset, Fig. 2b) based on the distance within which residents tend to travel to access natural resources (Fisher et al., 2011;Giannecchini, Twine, & Vogel, 2007). Finally, the sum of NDVI values within this buffer zone was calculated by household, then divided by the number of households in the buffer. The resulting metric serves as a surrogate for per household resource availability. To illustrate, the top panel inset of Fig. 2 shows the shaded within-village area on the bottom of the inset and the colored region towards the top of the buffer containing available and accessible natural resources. Fig. 2b illustrates household resource availability based on this calculation. Note that households toward village centers have lower resource availability.\\nIn addition to SES and the NDVI greenness metric, we include control variables that attained statistical significance in the analysis at the whole-population scale. The total number of independent variables was restricted in this way in order to facilitate localized analyses while maintaining sufficient degrees of freedom. Control variables include household size, proportion working age male, gender and marital status of household head, mean educational level within household, and proportion household members currently working. Additional household level resource variables were not available for the current study; however, prior migration work has, indeed, demonstrated the predictive value of the household level characteristics in our model (e.g., Kok, O\\'Donovan, Bouare, & Van Zyl, 2003;Lindstrom & Ramirez, 2010;Massey, Axinn, & Ghimire, 2010;Mberu, 2006;White & Lindstrom, 2006).',\n",
       "  'Methods': 'Understanding the role of geographic scale: nested regions of varying sizes Three nested geographic scales are examined by subdividing the set of surveyed household locations. First, the migrationenvironment association is modeled for the whole population, making use of all 9374 households. Next, the model is fit to each of the 21 villages separately, and finally, spatial variation within each village is examined through random generation of spatially contiguous subvillage regions which is repeated in 1000 permutations to test the stability of subvillage model associations. This repeated random regionalization is done in order to test whether the subvillage models show more robust \"local\" target associations and thus indicate a geographic scale at which spatial nonstationarity in such associations could be reduced or even removed.\\nAs such, increasingly \"localized\" outmigration models are estimated, still based on underlying (sub-)populations of sufficient size and variability to develop relatively robust statistical models. The strength of this approach is that it fits a simple Poisson (GLM) regression model to the households of each spatially contiguous region within each village and repeats the random simulation of subvillage regions. It thus allows the use of established diagnostic techniques such as the likelihood ratio test and the varianceinflation factor while objectively assessing spatial variation in the relationships of interest. The approach thus overcomes limitations of common local estimators (e.g., GWR) as described earlier and can be applied to count data.\\nNested subvillage regions were randomly generated such that they subdivide villages into smaller exclusive (non-overlapping), contiguous areas. Essentially, this technique constitutes a spatially constrained random permutation method. Our approach generates subvillage regions that contain a minimum of 47 and a maximum of 94 households in order to ensure that the smallest village is divided into two regions while all other subvillage regions cannot become larger than the smallest village. Thus villages are divided into subregions with a similar number of households (randomly varying between the two thresholds) while maintaining statistically acceptable sample sizes. Spatial contiguity in this regionalization process was achieved by randomly selecting two seed points (households) within each village. Regions were then generated by joining all remaining households with the closest seed point. This process was repeated until the size of all regions was between the two thresholds, creating the subvillage units (Fig. 3). We assessed the average model structure and performance over all 1000 regionalization runs in the subsequent modeling process. The same analysis was undertaken for 2002 and 2007 with the same simulated sets of subregions in order to ensure identical degrees of freedom for all models. This allows for comparison of significance levels and diagnostics between the two years.',\n",
       "  'Modeling, coefficient estimation and mapping': \"At each geographic scale (i.e., whole-population, village and subvillage), regressions (GLM) were fit for Poisson distributed household level temporary outmigration counts. For each model, coefficient estimates and their corresponding p-values were derived and residuals were tested for spatial autocorrelation using Global Moran's I (Moran, 1950) as well as for spatial clustering using Local Moran's I, a class of Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) (Anselin, 1995).\\nAt the subvillage scale, models were fit for random regions across the 1000 simulations and, for each subvillage model from each  simulation, the coefficient estimates and p-values were stored. Thus, for each household, coefficient estimates were stored from model runs on 1000 different configurations of random subvillage regions. Finally, we took the mean coefficient estimates for each household across all simulations and calculated the proportion of simulations where those coefficients were significant (p < 0.05). Thus, spatial distributions of varying mean model coefficients, and proportion of significant coefficients at the household level could be created based on a series of statistical subvillage models as described below.\\nAs for the mapping process, at the village scale we created maps of coefficient values and their statistical significance using village boundaries (polygon feature data). At the subvillage scale, we mapped mean coefficient estimates and the proportion of significant tests over 1000 model runs for each household location (point feature data). This mapping allowed us to visualize (1) changes in model structure across different geographic scales within the whole study area, (2) at each geographic scale, the spatial variation or spatial heterogeneity in the two target associations of interest (i.e., outmigration-SES and outmigration-NDVI), and (3) given the two time points (2002 and 2007), a temporal comparison of model coefficients and spatial distributions.\\nIn order to better understand the spatial structure of model performance, and thus to identify regions of potential clusters of under and over prediction, maps of LISA clusters (Anselin, 1995) on the model residuals were also created.\",\n",
       "  'Diagnostics for models at different geographic scales': \"Finally, the goodness-of-fit is assessed at each geographic scale using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Traditionally, AIC is used to compare models fit to the same population with different sets of predictor variables. Here, we compare the goodness-of-fit of two models with the same set of predictor variables but originally fit to different geographic scales (e.g., whole-population and village). AIC is generally calculated as:\\nAIC ¼ À2logðLÞ þ 2k (1\\n)\\nwhere L is the maximum likelihood estimate and k is the number of model parameters (Akaike, 1974). For n independent observations of a Poisson model, the log-likelihood function for the model with parameters b is:\\nlogLðbÞ ¼ X n i ¼ 1 ðy i logðm i Þ À m i Þ (2)\\nwhere m i is the fitted response value from the Poisson regression model for the observation y i (Rodríguez, 2007). As mentioned, AIC only allows a valid comparison between models when models are fit to the same population. Therefore, in order to compare the goodness-of-fit of models estimated on different geographic scales, we took the fitted response values m for the subset of observations from the coarser scale regression model which corresponded to the same observations used for fitting the finer scale regression model. For example, to compare the model for village number 1 (with 971 households) to the whole-population scale model, we took the 971 corresponding fitted values of m from the wholepopulation model and calculated the maximum likelihood estimate L. The AIC is then calculated using this value of L and compared to the AIC from the village model, computed with the traditional approach (Akaike, 1974). Decomposing the likelihood function of the coarser scale model in this way allows cross-scale comparisons of goodness-of-fit. This comparison was done between each village and the whole-population scale, and between each random subvillage region and the village scale for each of the 1000 simulations. Yet, a decrease in AIC of the more 'localized' model does not show whether the improvement (i.e., reduction in AIC) is statistically significant since the value has no intrinsic meaning (Sayyareh, Obeidi, & Bar-Hen, 2010). For this reason, we employed the Vuong likelihood ratio test (Vuong, 1989) to reliably identify where the finer scale of analysis performs more robust. Here, the comparison is between models considered overlapping i.e., (i) the two models have common distributional properties (Poisson) and (ii) neither model has a subset of parameters from the other (i.e. both models have the same independent variables) (Vuong, 1989, p. 320). In an empirical study, Genius and Strazzera (2002) showed that the Vuong test is more robust for comparing overlapping models than other tests (such as AIC or Cox test) for small sample sizes (recall that the subvillage regions have between 47 and 94 households). The Vuong test statistic for models f and g is:\\ny ¼ ffiffiffi n p LR n ð qn ; ĝn Þ ûn (3)\\nwhere LR n (q n ,g n ) is the log-likelihood ratio of the models f and g, and u n is the square root of the variance (i.e. standard deviation) of their point-wise log-likelihood ratios. That is:\\nu 2 n ¼ var log f ðy i jx i ; q n Þ gðy i jx i g n Þ(4)\\nA two-sided test is conducted where a critical value c from a standard normal distribution is selected based on the desired significance level, 0.05 in this case. If the test statistic v is greater than c, then model f performs better than model g. If v is less than Àc, then g is preferred over f. In the case that |v| c, then the two models cannot be discriminated (Vuong, 1989, p. 318).  \",\n",
       "  'Results and discussion': '',\n",
       "  'Whole-population scale models': \"Whole-population scale model diagnostics indicate that both explanatory variables of interest, SES and NDVI, are highly significant in 2002 and 2007 (p < 0.01) (Table 1). At increasingly localized geographic scales, however, the estimates show increasing spatial variation and increasing variance across regions (as discussed below). This suggests that the whole-population scale obscures considerable spatial variation in these associations across the study area.\\nThe whole-population model's residuals reveal significant spatial autocorrelation based on global Moran's I (p < 0.05), suggesting a non-random error structure due to spatial dependence. In both years, significant local clusters based on LISA measures of low and high residual values are well separated from each other and do not vary considerably between 2002 and 2007 (Fig. 4). Substantively, this translates to spatially clustered over-and underpredictions, respectively, and suggests the need for approaches accounting for spatial non-stationarity to better understand the target associations.\",\n",
       "  'Village scale models': 'At the village scale, considerable variation emerged in coefficient estimates across villages, as well as interesting patterns of change between the two years (Fig. 5). The overall outmigration-SES association on the village scale was stronger in 2007 compared to 2002 and showed higher spatial variation in 2002 (i.e., more stable in the later time period) (Fig. 5a). This indicates that households with higher SES were more likely to send migrants in 2007 relative to 2002.\\nAs for the NDVI greenness metric, there are high degrees of spatial variation that result in positive and negative relationships in both years with a slight trend of decreasing coefficient values (2002e2007). As such, no generalized statement as to the migration-environment association accurately characterizes the Agincourt study site as a whole.',\n",
       "  'Subvillage scale models': 'The subvillage scale reveals more refined spatial patterns of associations (Fig. 6). Within village boundaries, considerable spatial variation exists in both SES and NDVI coefficient estimates, indicating considerable local variation in their association with outmigration not reflected by village scale models.\\nFig. 6 reveals that an increase in natural resource access is associated with greater outmigration propensity for some households while decreasing the propensity for others, even in the same village. This high degree of spatial heterogeneity might be explained by two distinct mechanisms. First, access to natural resources acts as a form of capital which allows a household to  free human capital (Aggarwal, Netanyahu, & Romano, 2001) and to engage in migration as a form of livelihood diversification (Ellis, 2000). Second, the access to natural capital provides households with employment opportunities, wealth and livelihood security, and thus, might \"serve as an amenity, discouraging outmigration\" (Gray, 2009, p. 458). Which mechanism is primarily impacting the outmigration decision is a function of a household\\'s vulnerability and adaptive capacity in times of changing environments (Meze-Hausken, 2000), which is in turn influenced by households\\' SES.\\nAt this geographic scale, only a few villages show fairly homogeneous associations within their boundaries for either of the explanatory variables. However, the mean of subvillage coefficient estimates within each village is extremely close to corresponding village scale estimates for both SES and NDVI. For instance, in 2002 the difference between the subvillage mean coefficient estimates and the corresponding village estimate was 0.07 and 0.29 for SES and NDVI, respectively.\\nThe proportion of significant coefficients (p < 0.05) over the 1000 model simulations (Fig. 7) provide additional information about the average significance of the model associations in explaining household temporary outmigration. The subvillage coefficient estimates show consistent proportions of significant models for both variables in both years. Fig. 7 illustrates clustering of significance proportions at the subvillage scale again indicating considerable variation of the observed relationships at this geographic scale.',\n",
       "  'Multiscale model diagnostics': \"The simple structure of nested Poisson models allows for the use of robust, well-established diagnostic methods and tests for goodness-of-fit for all three geographic scales. As a visual diagnostic, we plotted the temporary migration counts against the predicted values for each of the three geographic scales. This standard procedure shows a drastic improvement in prediction from the whole-population to subvillage scale (Fig. 8) substantiated by comparing the residuals' mean squared error at each scale (Table 2).\\nThe results of the AIC comparison also show consistent reduction of AIC at finer nested geographic scales for both years (Table 2). When testing for significance using the Vuong's likelihood ratio test, we found 86 and 62 percent improvements for village scale over the whole-population scale model in 2002 and 2007, respectively. The subvillage scale exhibited 44 and 43 percent mean improvements over the village scale in 2002 and 2007, respectively, and from whole-population scale to subvillage scale, improvement was 64 and 60 percent for 2002 and 2007, respectively. Maps of proportion significant improvements over the village and whole-  population scales identify where subvillage scale models better reveal the target associations (Fig. 9).\\nFinally, in order to better understand the impacts of increasingly localized, nested geographic scales on the structure of the data and subsequently on model results, two principal concerns must be addressed: (i) induced multicollinearity of the explanatory variables at finer geographic scales, and (ii) spatial autocorrelation of model residuals across geographic scales.\\nMulticollinearity can confound coefficient estimates and compromise interpretation. The variance-inflation factor (VIF) is a common diagnostic to assess multicollinearity in a dataset (Hill & Adkins, 2007). Most thresholds above which multicollinearity is considered severe vary between 4 and 10 (O'brien, 2007). In the present analyses, most subvillage models led to VIF values below 2; very few were above 4 and none above 7. The whole-population and village scales did not exhibit values above 2 (Fig. 10). Combined, the VIFs suggest multicollinearity is stable and not affecting data structure at finer geographic scales.\\nAs for the model residuals, the whole-population scale exhibits significant local spatial autocorrelation of errors (Fig. 4) consisting of a total of 663 and 644 clusters in 2002 and 2007, respectively. At the village scale, this was reduced to 624 and 618 in 2002 and 2007, respectively. The mean model residuals across all 1000 simulations at the subvillage scale exhibited 484 and 391 total clusters in 2002 and 2007, respectively (Table 2). Thus the spatial refinement actually reduces local spatial autocorrelation of the error structure.  \",\n",
       "  'Concluding remarks and outlook': 'Environmental conditions are increasingly being examined, in concert with socio-economic attributes, as potential factors shaping outmigration especially from rural, natural resource-dependent regions. Yet the effects of geographic scale of input for migration models as well as of spatial dependence and non-stationarity in corresponding associations remain hidden when using global statistical models for the whole population. The framework presented here allows examination of whether refining the geographic scale reduces effects of spatial non-stationarity in migrationenvironment associations and thus allows for more robust models to be computed. Based on the spatial permutation method, local coefficients can be estimated in a statistically robust way to identify spatial non-stationarity. This approach is built on a Poisson GLM framework (which can readily be applied to other GLM families, i.e. binomial or gamma) for local estimation which includes a suite of well-established diagnostic techniques. The strength of this approach is the development of full models with sufficient statistical power even at the subvillage geographic scale thereby allowing for reliable evaluation and interpretation of the results.\\nComparing model diagnostics such as the AIC and Vuong test across different nested geographic scales revealed that in general a finer scale model for temporary outmigration is indeed more robust and therefore captures the associations between migration and SES and NDVI more reliably. Further, quantification of the variation in our target associations across sub-populations at the same scale (e.g., across all villages) revealed that even within villages there is considerable non-stationarity in such model relationships. This spatial non-stationarity could indicate that community-level dynamics, which exist on the subvillage scale, are very important and influential for migration decisions on the household level. This also raises important questions regarding the degree of variation in migration-related associations that has to be expected within political or administrative units such as villages but is not captured when using traditional model approaches using global statistical models.\\nIn this study we show that the associations between temporary outmigration and explanatory variables, SES and NDVI, produce different but high degrees of spatial variation across the study site, illustrating the inherent complexity in the system and the need for local estimation models. Interestingly, we discovered considerable differences in resulting patterns between the two years of interest suggesting that target associations at even the finest geographic scale change under varying environmental conditions. In other words, there is indication that environmental change impacts model associations, thus suggesting that environmental variables derived at the household level are relevant in explaining temporary outmigration on all geographic scales investigated.\\nFuture research will examine interactions between socioeconomic factors and environmental measures and will also include refined NDVI-derived measures. Further analysis of data from the AHDSS Surveillance Site for additional points in time will also yield nuance in the substantive interpretation afforded by application of these methodological advancements to populationenvironmental modeling in the Agincourt study site. In addition, the extensive time series available of NDVI data from satellite imagery will provide a better understanding of the spatio-temporal migration-environment associations in resource-dependent communities.'},\n",
       " 21: {'abstract': 'Climate change has been presented as a likely trigger for migration of people, especially in dryland areas of less developed countries. The underlying research questions focus on the strength of adaptation capacity of subsistence farmers in Northern Ethiopia, and evaluate historical experiences gained from drought-induced migration. Through a survey of 104 peasants who had to migrant due to persistent drought, vulnerability to climate change has shown to be a complex issue, including the multiplicity of factors comprising a household environment. Still, to be vulnerable does not make someone a potential climate migrant, as people in marginal regions have developed a great variety of adaptation mechanisms, which strengthen their ability to cope with both, slow climatic changes and extreme climatic events.',\n",
       "  'Introduction and Objectives': \"The fact that climate can trigger waves of migrants is not a new notion. Throughout the whole human history, weather-related human movements have left their traces. Wood (1995) reminds us that Homo erectus' ancestors migrated out of Africa some million years ago, maybe driven by (un)favourable climate in the home-or receiving area. Ancient populations settled in North America after crossing the Bering Strait to Alaska during the milder periods of the middle of the last ice age. And tribes invaded prosperous Egypt 4000 years BP while pressed by drought and resource deficits in their own countries (Lamb 1995). It is evident that past climatic changes have contributed to a considerable extent in shaping today's population distribution on the globe.\\nSince the first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990 (Houghton et al. 1990) research emphasis has been placed on two issues, (1) how anthropogenic emissions have and will in the future contribute in changing global climate, and (2) how this human-induced climate change might affect human life and nature. Although climate change, especially on a regional scale, is, in many respects, uncertain (Mitchell and Hulme 1999), it involves a potentially serious threat to vulnerable populations. Reactions to extremes in climate variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind, as well as simple preferences or dislike and stress, might find their outermost expression in human migration to more suitable regions. The IPCC (Houghton 1996) has identified a number of potentially serious climatic changes, including an increase in the incidence of drought in regions like Africa. Pessimistic predictions estimate many millions of refugees by the middle of next century, driven by hunger, drought and climatic extremes such as hurricanes or flooding as a result of global climate change (Myers and Kent 1995;Martin and Lefebvre 1995;Trolldalen et al. 1992;Ayres and Walter 1991). This raises speculations about dramatic population movements in the decades ahead.\\nResearch in climatic-induced migration involves three broad thematic areas of discourse: climatic reconstructions as the documentation of short-and long-term chronologies in climate change, analysis of impact of climate on social life, and the investigation of climate as a motivating factor for migration. But so far much of the literature considers environment-migration relations at a very general level. The arguments are often Malthusian and draw on little localised empirical research on migrant coping strategies (McGregor 1993). Gosh (1992) and Lohmann (1994) present a typology of migrants based on four root causes of migration.\\n• survival migration • opportunity-seeking migration • environmental migration • flight due to persecution and conflict In the first three causes or motivations, climate could be a driving force for population movement, and in the fourth, climate and environmental degradation could trigger resource conflicts resulting in migration. When analysing historical and contemporary cases, climate per se is seldom found to be the root of migration, but rather one that exacerbates difficult living conditions at the margin of subsistence (Kritz 1990). Therefore, other influences like political, economic or ethnic conditions should not be neglected when dealing with impacts of environmental and climatic change on migration.\\nIn the underlying study, I investigate empirical consequences of climatic perturbations on human adaptation and migration in dryland Africa. Particular focus in placed on subsistence farmers in mixed agricultural systems, living in regions characterised by aridity (low rainfall or evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation most of the year) and high interannual rainfall variability (for a comprehensive discussion on dryland definitions, see Mortimore 1998). The hypothesis is that experience from past drought behaviour during the last decades can serve as an analogy for impacts under future climate change. It is evident that there are multiple, dynamic and complex factors involved in motivating migration. However, within the limited framework of this study, I will mainly concentrate on elaborating the links between climatic events and people's vulnerability to it, and how people cope with such crises in reducing the risk of climatic induced migration. In specific, the paper will discuss (1) how severity of climate variability can be assessed, ( 2) what indicators describe vulnerability of households to climate change and the relationship between climate vulnerability and number of months after onset of a drought until a household migrates, and (3) how survival strategies contribute in withstanding a crisis as well as the importance and chronology of individual survival strategies adopted during drought.\",\n",
       "  'Material and Method': \"The approach is based on a historical analogy with data derived from a fieldstudy in Tigray, North Ethiopia (see Figure 1) and from findings in the literature. The analogy approach, although providing only rudimentary approximation of regional impacts in the future (Glantz 1991) serves to identify societal response to regional climate change. Analogies can also be drawn between physical changes that have occurred (e.g. dry periods) and those likely under future anthropogenic global warming. Although acknowledging the non-linearity of human reactions to recurrent events, it is based on the premise that households will in the near future conduct adaptation strategies similarly to those in the recent past. According to Glantz (1991), 'historical studies have an air of reality that gives their findings a level of credibility that computer generated scenarios of the future lack'. The information gained by analogy approach is based on real events and cannot easily be dismissed as mere theorising or scare tactics (Glantz 1996). In such lies its potential value in identifying society's strengths and weaknesses in dealing with climate events by analysing the recent climate history, regardless of the cause (Cortner 1990, quoted in Glantz 1996).\\nForecasting potential human impacts by analogy requires baseline information on recent climatic conditions which have some probability of representing the situation under future anthropogenic climatic change. The importance of good analogies is not so much the number of similarities between a chosen past situation and a likely future, but rather the significance of the similarities (Jamieson 1988). Ethiopia is known for its generally high rainfall variability. The well-known droughts of the 1970s and 80s prevailing over the whole Sahel including large parts of Ethiopia serve as an especially useful baseline. Abundant documentation, particularly the countless empirical-technical reports on famine and farm coping strategies which have been produced by aid organisations and research institutes during the late 1980s and early 1990s, assess the extent of the great famine years between 1983-85. When giving recommendations about adaptation actions to reduce the likelihood of famine, these reports do not incorporate the possibility of a future climate change with long-term consequences on farming systems. Still, they serve as a highly valuable resource for baseline information on drought vulnerability and impacts at the household level. Knowledge gained by analysing them and comparing them with first-hand information of drought migrants and aspects of future climate change can provide some key information to policy makers on likely impacts regarding human outmigration from areas with unreliable rainfall. Still, the possibility of surprise of either climatic situations or human response should be included.\\nDuring the fieldwork in southern Tigray, a rapid rural appraisal on 104 former drought migrants was performed, as well as interviews with administrative personnel and project planners for disaster prevention. The task was to investigate how an individual becomes a climate migrant. Distinguishing a 'climate migrant' from a political migrant demanded that the former migrant himself personally perceived drought or the climatic situation as the main, and often only reason for migration. Due to the fact that the drought episodes during the 1970s and 80s in Ethiopia coincided with civil war, the interviewees had to be selected carefully in order to exclude those for whom the political situation had been a driving force and climate instability only an exaggerating factor for their migration decision. My interest was to characterise such migrants by the features making them vulnerable to drought disasters and to follow chronologically the actions they undertook from the onset of drought to avert famine until migration. The aim was to develop qualitative impressions rather than to obtain a quantitative and statistically representative sample. Statistical data on migrants during past drought decades state questionable and inconsistent numbers (Wolde Mariam 1994) ranging from 116,000 to 1.32 million of the 2.4 million Tigrinian population in during the beginning of the 1980s and 5.6 million internal Ethiopian migrants. (Office of the Population and Housing Census Commission 1991). It would be misleading to declare the majority of them as purely climate migrants, due to coinciding political instability. Still, as rural Tigray has mostly mixed farming systems, based on rain-fed crops such as wheat, barley and teff (E. abyssinica, a main cereal in Ethiopia), as well as grazing animals, they all were at least partially affected by harvest failure and water scarcity. It can be assumed that the further they lived away from roads, the less civil war was an influence factor for their migration decision.\\nThese 104 former drought migrants were originally from subsistence farming households, living today within a one-hour drive from the main road between Addis Abeba and Eritrea in South Tigray. The questionnaire collected data on individual in-and return-migrants. In-migrants were those who moved to the area from another region due to drought and stayed there. Returnees came back to the place of origin, some right after the drought, most a couple of years later. Those who ended up in Eritrea returned in 1998 forced by the ongoing conflicts between the two neighbouring countries. The people were asked about living conditions before the drought which resulted in migration; the onset of drought, resulting coping mechanisms and migration process; experiences of earlier droughts; perception of current environmental degradation; and expectations regarding the future of their children. For the in-migrants only, additional information regarding reasons for not returning, as well as revisits to and impressions of the place of origin were investigated. The survey was not restricted to behaviour during a specific drought period but covered drought and migration during the memory span of a person. The rationale was to have the general process of migration in mind, regardless of influences by ongoing political conflicts, land reform etc. One shortcoming of this approach could be neglect in the analysis of how people's behaviour was affected by the political changes from a monarchical to a dictatorial and finally a democratic system. Still, as for the future, the political situation cannot be predicted at all and the climate condition only with some amount of uncertainty, it is mainly the broad and general response of households to climate events, which makes sense to be evaluated and possibly extrapolated into future climate change scenarios.\\nEthiopia has a very fragile environment, characterised by high level of soil erosion (e.g. Kuru 1986; Transitional Government of Ethiopia 1992) and deforestation (Transitional Government of Ethiopia 1992), a process which slowly but surely has occurred over large stretches of the country since medieval times (Pankhurst 1992). With its long agricultural history (Wudassie 1991), natural resource depletion and environmental degradation by progressive occupation of marginal lands has occurred, producing a society which is very sensitive to fluctuations in natural events. The reason for choosing the Tigray area was that the region has had a comprehensive history of droughts and famines (see Table I further below), the earliest recorded one occurred in 253-242 BC (Degefu 1987). Even if the accuracy of dating famine events might be lacking in the early years of the records, it certainly gives clear indication of the deep-rooted experiences people have in averting famine. Since the land reform in 1975, all land has been owned by the state and distributed to the people according to household size (difficulties arising from this are described by Wolde-Georgis 1993). In Tigray, land holding size is currently about 0.3ha per capita (based on population and housing census 1994 for Tigray Region) with average yield for all the crops in the region of about 5 quintals/ha (Ezra 1997; 1 quintal = 100 kg).\\nTigray has two types of rainfall regimes, monomodal in the western and central parts and a bimodal one in the east (Transitional Government of Ethiopia 1992;Degefu 1987). Here farmers have registered a gradual reduction in the short spring rains and a tendency towards a more frequently delayed main rainy season since the seventies (Marque and Rosenwald 1997). This trend has been corroborated, when studying the agricultural calendar, by a generally shorter growing period since the 1970s compared to the 1930-50 period (Marque and Rosenwald 1997). Total amount of rainfall lies between 400 and 800 mm per year in most parts of Tigray with precipitation exceeding evapotranspiration only during July and August. Nearly all land is rain-fed agriculture. Nevertheless, farmers have adapted to the long-term water supply conditions and are successful in coping with short-term rainfall deficits.\",\n",
       "  'The Conceptual Framework': \"Deducible from the paper title, the topic covers several disciplines and as such could be approached from a variety of angles. Although investigating a specific climate impact, this research should not be considered as a traditional climate impact assessment (IPCC 1994;Parry and Carter 1998) following a seven step framework beginning with definition of the problem (drought migration) to development of scenarios (for example 30% outmigration due to 40 percent reduction of rainfall by 2030) through to the establishment of adaptation strategies for averting the impact in the future. Instead, the focus is set on understanding and analysing the links and processes between climate and human actions in a more general perspective rather than describing specific states.\\nMigration is considered to be a second order climate impact having its roots in directly affected processes such as agricultural yield and growth, water supply, soil formation, and pest infestation. As such, the cause-effect relationship between climate and migration is not so obvious to allow a straightforward approach. There are two explanations for this. First, climate change, and in specific drought is obviously only one out of many factors causing migration. And second, drought-induced migration is in many cases a result of famine. But not every drought necessarily leads to famine, and conversely, not every famine has its roots in drought. In addition, even during a famine, people have many possibilities other than migration for coping with such disasters.\\nMuch research has been done on the causes of famine in Ethiopia, although no definite conclusion exists about its origin. Perceptions of the problem differ with reference to the relative importance of war, policy failure, food distribution problems, poverty, subsistence farming, environmental degradation, population in- crease, land holding policy, entitlements, etc (Wolde Mariam 1994;Wolde-Giorgis 1989;Alemneh 1990;Pankhurst 1988). It would be tremendously difficult and subjective again, to rank these factors, as their importance varies from region to region and from household to household. Still, for most farmers, the link between rainfall failure, pest and disease on the one side, and agricultural output on the other side is indisputable.\\nThe following presents a simplified model of migration as a response to climate change. The framework consists of three components, each with one contributing variable (Figure 2). The components include a farmer, his exposure to climate, and a possible migration. Still, how a farmer then finally reacts to changes in climate, depends on the severity of the change, his vulnerability and the available strategies in order to avert the worst impacts. The components and variables are first described theoretically, then empirical results from Tigray -as an example of a dryland agricultural region -are presented.\\nThe first component concerns the individual in question, a subsistence farmer in dryland Africa. He or she is tied intimately to the land of his ancestors, the culture and social traditions of the place of origin. Still, the farmer is permanently preoccupied with attempts to alleviate the nagging daily hunger (Wolde Mariam 1994). The familiarity with high year-to-year variability in rainfall has made one's life welladapted to such marginal lifestyle, either by holding animals to be sold during dry years, by off-farm livelihood activities or by seasonal migration. It should be noted that the environmental context within which a farmer has historically adapted is not simply climatic, but includes other perturbations like disease, erosion and weed infestation. Although in some cases self-supporting, the contact to the local market for buying and selling crops is vital. Rarely more than the basic human needs can be covered, thus even in years with sufficient rainfall, the farmer struggles in securing food for his family. During 1994-95 where rainfall was considered sufficient, not more than 18% of the people in Tigray were self-supporting (Wolde-Georgis 1993). Still even this does not necessarily mean adequate food but rather Figure 3. Variations of the level of Lake Chad over the last 80,000 years (Lamb 1988, with permission). chronic undernourishment. Fifty-six percent of the population had a food shortage of between four and nine months (Planning Office Tigray 1997).\\nThe second component relates to climate with rainfall variability as the most critical characteristic of African climate for resource application (Hulme 1992). We have to distinguish between, but not necessarily separate, two types of climatic issues: single drought events and long-term change in climate, whereby short-term instability (drought) can be superimposed on longer-term transitions (Mortimore 1998). Changes for African dryland climate can result in\\n• a shift towards warmer, colder, wetter or drier conditions • narrowing or widening in the rainfall variability • a decrease or increase in the range of occasional events (Lamb 1988). Climatologically, droughts are slowly evolving phenomena, and their arrival cannot be determined with precision. They can be described as a continuous period during which a cumulative rainfall deficit exceeds the drought threshold, a level predefined by a deviation of the rainfall mean (Tarhule and Woo 1997) and includes the temporal distribution of rain within a rainy season. Whether rare and long dry spells lasting a succession of years or even decades can be ascribed to a transitional phase in climate change, depends on the historical time span (10 years-1000 years) in focus. So-called 'normal' rainfall in the semiarid tropics is perhaps fictional. For subsistence farmers with rain-fed agriculture variability is the current norm (Watts 1983). Mortimore (1998, p. 180) defines dryland ecosystems as '(a) unstable and disequilibrial in the short term, and (b) transitional in the long term, fluctuating on a historical time scale between humid and dry climates over large regions'. Predicting future climate raises questions regarding determinants of past climate in Ethiopia. Long term changes over the past 10,000 years have their main causes in external factors such as changes in the earth's orbit around the sun and internal factors related to global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (e.g. Houghton 1994). But except for the last 150 years, CO 2 concentrations have been relatively stable during the last 4000 years (Hulme 1990in NEDECO 1997). A study aimed at deriving sub-Saharan precipitation from variations in the level of Lake Chad (see Figure 3), shows that there have been considerable shifts between wet and dry climates, sometimes sharp, sometimes smooth, explained by changes in the global energy budget and manifested in changes of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Specifically, for Ethiopia, rainfall regimes have been mainly determined by large-scale circulation changes such as the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), bringing the monsoon rains, and less regionalscale phenomena such as desertification (Nicholson 1989).\\nMigration is the third component, defined in this case, when a farmer leaves his home due to climatic-induced reasons. Conceptually, we distinguish climatic disasters such as drought from environmental degradation and long-term climatic changes. Emanating from this, one could logically refer on the one end of a continuum to migrants as those displaced by slow environmental change (e.g. land degradation, deforestation), where migration is mainly driven by better opportunities somewhere else, and on the other end of the continuum to refugees who are driven from home by necessity, as their pure survival is at stake (see Figure 4). Refugees, in the context of environmental change, are exposed to natural disasters with rapid onset and rather unexpected occurrence (e.g. tornadoes, tsunamis). But within this article, out of practicality the term 'migrant' refers to both, slow and sudden changes in climate, whereby the notion 'distress' migration relates to the specific emergency situation. Burton et al. (1993) show four characteristic patterns of behaviour of people living in a hazard zone: (1) deny the hazard, ignore it, (2) tolerate the prospective loss without taking countermeasures, (3) take action to prevent impacts in their location and (4) take significant action including abandoning the hazard zone.\\nUnder elemental and rapid-onset disruption, migration can be considered as the final, and often desperate step in a chain of actions to avert starvation and death. In such cases, push factors are the dominating driving force for moving. The flight towards camps, towns and relatives is often linked with the strong hope to return as soon as the conditions allow it. But when migration follows slow-onset changes in climate and environmental conditions, it is often associated with the abandonment of one's land. The migrant's action then is to search for a better living somewhere else as prospects of sustainable farming income cannot be guaranteed any more. Pull factors such as labour demand, land availability and fertility and reliability in rainfall attract the migrant. Slow and rapid-onset disruptions have in common that migration involves a deliberate choice, where individual costs and benefits of relocation are evaluated. But it includes a good proportion of personal perceptions, emotions and pessimism about future climate and living conditions at the place of origin.\",\n",
       "  'SEVERITY OF EVENT': \"When reports or newspapers describe the severest drought in human memory or damages caused by a prolonged and severe drought, it is essential to understand the deeper meaning of severity. The severity of an event has a time and a space component, whereby space can be, but not necessarily is, correlated with the number of people affected by the event. The difference between a climate event and a climate change is one of time span. An accumulation of events or an increase in duration of events above a pre-defined threshold could be considered as a climate change, depending on the aspect in focus and relative to some time frame. Still, among climate scientists there is no widely accepted theory about what time frames should be preferred for distinguishing a climatic change from climate events or climate variability (Jamieson 1988). Operationalizing the term (see Figure 5) can be done by indicating the 'strength' and the 'speed of onset' of a climatic event.\\n'Strength' in this drought study refers to the duration of dryness, and the intensity of dryness, for example a percentage of rainfall reduction from the mean. 'Speed of onset' could be expressed by how fast the changes in climate occur, for example a slow reduction in rainfall over a long-term period, compared to a sudden switch towards drier conditions. These variables, strength and speed, can be determined by standard statistical analysis of climate data. But climate statistics are not enough to capture the true implications of such events. Instead, the ecosystem and human response arising from climate events have to be included when describing severity. And this depends on the frequency of events (the number of events per period), the temporal spacing (how closely the events lie to each other in time) and the spatial distribution within a region. It can be argued that annual rainfall deficits have a cumulative effect (Tarhule and Woo 1997) such that a succession of drought years will lead to a worsening of a drought overall, especially related to agriculture, but less in hydrological or climatological terms. A regionally restricted drought will lead to much less dramatic impacts than, for example, the 1984-85 Ethiopian drought prevailing over large parts of the country.\\nBut drought is not simply a climatic anomaly, but the social perception of a natural phenomenon (García 1981). Perceptions are to a considerable extent formed by expectations one has about a certain issue, and experiences from similar past events. An Irish farmer would probably consider a month without rainfall as a drought; whereas people in Ethiopia might have quite different views about such weather phenomena. The reason for this might be that when we speak about drought we do not think about natural conditions objectively, but in terms of their effect on man. Based on this, the 'severity of an event' can be equivalent to 'damage', the 'loss or harm resulting from injury to a person, nature, property or reputation'. Damage stems less from a straightforward reduction of rainfall, but from a combination of natural as well as socio-economic, technological and perceptional conditions. Perceptions can aggravate a situation and even 'produce' a drought even if the seasonal quantity and distribution of rainfall is sufficient, as people do not recognise that the causes for reduced water availability stem from for example increased river runoff due to deforestation (Du Toit 1985).\",\n",
       "  'VULNERABILITY': \"Human vulnerability is the second precondition determining the impact drought might have on migration. Vulnerability is a widely used and often arbitrarily applied term referring to the weakness or inability to cope with a specific situation or event. The IPCC (Watson et al. 1996) describes vulnerability as 'the potential for negative consequences which can be defined at different scales, including yield, farm or farm sector, regional economic or hunger vulnerability'. Vulnerability is the product of a system (Wolde Mariam 1994) and -for assessing human welfare -derives from aggregating environmental, social, economic and political exposure (Downing et al. 1996;Downing 1991). The concept refers to the consequences of harmful perturbations and attempts to investigate the reasons and sources of this weakness. Garcia (1981) mentions the high structural vulnerability imposed on a society by unstable socio-economic and political situations and low levels of infrastructure and technology. A more radical view relates vulnerability to the theory of marginalization (Susman et al. 1983). It emphasises that vulnerability differs between social classes, implying that some people have to move to or live in risky areas because of a lack of choices. Created by social forces, vulnerability is exacerbated by intervening adverse effects of a physical nature (Wolde Mariam 1994). Depending on the structural situation, vulnerability can be chronic, such as deep-rooted malnutrition, or transitory (Crawshaw and Shaw 1995), presuming that the precarious period can either be overcome by either itself or by external intervention. Resilience as a loose antonym for vulnerability increases the capacity to cope with stress or perturbations (Maxwell and Frankenberger 1992;Adger 2000). But under significant stress, population displacement is often an indicator of the breakdown of social resilience (Adger 2000).\\nTo be vulnerable presumes to be in risk of (1) exposure to a crisis, (2) severe consequences, and (3) inadequate capacity (Bohle et al. 1994;Downing et al. 1996). The risk of exposure covers the physical side of an event, here a climate disaster or long-term change. The consequences and capacity cover the social/organisational and motivational/attitudinal aspect, respectively (Wolde-Georgis 1993), describing the contribution of the community to ameliorate the impact, as well as their perception of the event and willingness to avert possible consequences.\",\n",
       "  'SURVIVAL STRATEGIES': 'Survival strategies are actions which a person, household or societal system undertakes to avert and cope with a crisis after a disruptive event. They have to be distinguished from risk minimising strategies which are often, but not necessarily applied in expectation of a certain event. Such risk minimising strategies are a kind of insurance mechanism. For example, a farmer may try to diversify his income between peasantry, animal husbandry and seasonal off-farm work to assure one income source should one or more of the others fail. Survival strategies are applied both in order to avert starvation, and in a later stage, to prevent migration even under famine conditions. Rahmato (1991) distinguishes anticipatory and crisis survival strategies, whereby the difference between the two is one of degree and crisis survival strategy is often an extension of anticipatory survival strategies. Survival strategies under famine have been exhaustively treated in the literature, in both general and specific terms (Maxwell and Frankenberger 1992;Rahmato 1991;Wolde-Georgis 1993;Wolde Mariam 1984;Ezra 1997;Webb 1993). They vary according to availability, subjective prospects of success, culture, ecological zones, social and political restrictions. The more stratified the human and household assets are, and the greater the choice of strategies available, the longer can these strategies prolong the period of food availability even under harsh conditions. The type of strategies employed will further vary depending upon the severity and duration of the potentially disruptive condition (Thomas et al. 1989). This is also influenced by expected responses and strategies of other households (Rahmato 1991).',\n",
       "  'Results from the Study Area': 'For the Tigray study region, the previously described influencing variables for migration decisions, vulnerability, severity of an event and coping strategies, have been investigated.

Rainfall records from the last 30 years (Ademe and Kinfe 1998) show a general decrease in annual rainfall in the north, south, west and east and an oscillation around the mean in central Ethiopia and in the north-east lowlands (Figure 6). This trend towards increasing aridity has been shown not to be unprecedented within historical times (Nicholson 1994).\\nPredicting future development in rainfall shows great uncertainty with regard to direction, timing, variability, and extreme events, especially for the Tropics (Hulme and Viner 1998). Ademe and Kinfe (1998) have assessed climate scenarios for Ethiopia based on three global circulation models (GCMs). Projections for future temperature show an increase of between 0.5 • C and more than 3 • C. Rainfall results do not manifest a systematic increase or decrease. In the north of the country, predicted changes in precipitation vary between a doubling and a reduction of 30-40%. For rain-fed agriculture, a reduction in rainfall as the main climatic limiting factor has similar negative impacts as an increase in temperature together with increase in precipitation. In the latter case, the effectiveness of rainfall in watering the soil will be reduced by increased evaporation. This great disparity of model predictions for the future Ethiopian climate strengthens the argument that historical information on climate events provides a solid basis for evaluating continued drought which could strike the region in the near term.',\n",
       "  'VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE IN TIGRAY': \"Operationalizing vulnerability has so far proven to be imperfect. It is not associated with widely accepted indicators or methods of measurement (Downing et al. 1996). As a multi-factor assessment, the choice in selecting indicators has to be argued in a location and purpose specific setting, and will always involve elements of arbitrariness and subjectivity. A further shortcoming with such an index-based analysis relates to the weighing and summing up of the individual indicators.\\nMy study in North Ethiopia builds upon 14 factors determining the vulnerability to climate-related migration. (See Table II). Some of the factors are more static, related to demography and household assets. Others involve dynamic elements such as the range of survival strategies involved or additional environmental disasters enhancing the effect of a climate event. The current study vulnerability, defined as a compilation of indicators means not necessarily to be female, old and widowed or engaged in a specific working environment such as rural dweller or smallholder (e.g. as described by Kloos and Lindtjorn 1994;Bohle et al. 1994). It further does not focus primarily on macro-indicators such as GDP/capita, infant mortality, illiteracy rate, infant mortality, deforestation rate, rate of soil erosion and similar regional variables, as those do not represent the specific situation of people in a certain area. Here, it is more specific location oriented, addressing relevant household data on entitlements, social structure, perceptions and physical/natural conditions, including diversification of assets, non-agricultural income, distance to water well and fire-wood, and other indicators, listed in Table II. There would certainly be more indicators relevant to describe vulnerability to climate-induced migration, such as gender differentiation of household heads or kin networks. But those presented here are considered as the most important ones with respect to food/water demand and supply and migration decision, and have been most mentioned during the interviews as 'problem areas' for famine, push factors for migration or restricting factors for performing coping strategies. The hypothesis behind this 'micro-view'-approach is that impacts of drought can strike anyone concerned, not only the poor.

For example, a weight of 1 for families of more than five persons supports the hypothesis that larger families are more vulnerable to climate events and more likely to migrate under drought conditions. In Figure 7, total vulnerability has been correlated with months until migration, after onset of a drought. The vulnerability index is based on the indicators described in Table II. The quantitative relationship, a simple addition of values given to the indicators is not necessarily the all-inclusive mathematically correct one, but is only suggested to illustrate the point. The results represented by a regression line show surprisingly that for the 104 households interviewed, there is generally no direct link between the level of vulnerability and the time of relocation. People who are most vulnerable leave after a similar number of months as those who are considered to be least vulnerable. Two explanations can be given for this performance. Those who are less vulnerable are often economically advantaged families, relatively speaking, with some kind of social network, such as relatives in towns where they could move to during a crisis. Money for enabling transport out of the disaster region is also often more available to wealthier families. Or, alternatively, it could reveal the existence of a kind of threshold, a limit within the society with respect to climate, making all people in the region similarly negatively affected by drought, independent of their initial entitlements and household-situation. When this threshold is reached, basic survival needs such as water and food become scarce or even unavailable. Under such conditions, a farmer with big animal herds has similar difficulties in securing water for his animals as one having just a single cow, and all might die of thirst. The same threshold situation is valid for households with additional off-farm income. After a certain period when everyone's resources for acquiring food have been used up, one, for example, will no longer buy homebrewed beer or hire labourers, a clear indication of the interdependency between households in a region.\\nAs already indicated above, no single indicator would capture the totality of vulnerability to migration. Nevertheless, when analysing individual vulnerability sub-indicators with respect to the time from the drought onset until people migrate, some findings suggest that families with more survival strategies tend to resist distress migration longer than those having only few survival strategies. Further, smaller families seem to migrate earlier than larger families. At least, many of them indicated that they were among the first ones in the village to leave. A splitting of large families, meaning that some of their members migrate earlier, was not obvious. The reason for the earlier departure of smaller households might be the better prospects to get accommodated at a new place, the availability of money for transport (many migrated long distances by bus) and fewer options for generating off-farm income, as human resources were needed for fetching water and firewood from places far away. Political instability was not found to have a direct effect on the timing of migration. Half of the survey participants stated that they were at least to some extent influenced in their migration decision by the ongoing war. But all of them stated, and that was the necessary precondition for the study, that drought was the primary reason for migration. Both groups, those who at least partially and those not affected by civil war, spent on average the same number of months from the onset of drought until migration. Therefore, the war cannot necessarily be identified directly as pushing migration forward or holding people back from leaving their homes. Still, war increased people's vulnerability to drought in that way that it affected the performance success of survival strategies which are discussed in the following.\",\n",
       "  'SURVIVAL STRATEGIES OF TIGRINIAN FARMERS': \"Most people in the survey had a wide repertoire of strategies to avert famine, mostly changing consumption patterns (reducing from three to one daily meal or switching to less valuable kinds of grain), selling animals and household assets and using up food reserves (as far as they have from previous years). For more detail, see Figure 8. Nearly every family (92 percent) performed at least three strategies for survival, and one in two families tried six different ones to prolong the period of residence in the village. This shows a marked resistance of people to the external event.  The importance of individual coping mechanisms is easily revealed. The first actions undertaken ones are normally the more important ones, in the sense that they have a greater influence on food provision, or those which are easiest to undertake (see Figure 9). Due to individual differences between households, their different point of departure and situation, the chronological order of survival strategies varies from family to family.\\nThe chronology of a drought-induced migration of an average household in Tigray might have looked like the following. Rain failure in either June/July or early cessation of the summer monsoon in August gives little hope to the family of a successful harvest. Although malnourished from before, with food stocks already exhausted 6-8 months after the last harvest, they immediately start to reduce their daily consumption of teff and might switch to lower value grain types. Wild fruits are collected, one member is sent out of the village to search for work. During September-October, the last grain reserves become exhausted, and the head of the family decides to sell livestock and then oxen. By December, liquid assets are no longer available, and household and farming tools are sold on the local market. Although of little value, they provide money for grain purchase for another 1-2 months. When these last assets are sold and people have to migrate, the chance to return soon after a drought is quite small, as farmers do not have capital to invest in new farming equipment and oxen for ploughing. By February, all possible options for obtaining food have become exhausted and the family decides to migrate together to the nearest town in hope of food aid and work. They might stay away from their home for 1-2 years, maybe even longer as they have no money for return or no information whether the situation at home has improved. They might also feel too ashamed to return to their village without oxen and a plough, as these goods represent important social status within the local community.\\nThe application of individual strategies is often accompanied by problems, which Bovin and Manger (1990) refer to as a crisis of traditional forms of adaptation. They cannot be solely understood on the basis of environmental constraints, but also within the context of social and cultural problems (Bovin and Manger 1990). As many migrants were affected by the drought coinciding with the Ethiopian civil war, many were disturbed in carrying out off-farm activities and trading, as they were forced to stay within their local region. Food aid did not reach their villages due to political conflicts. for the people in the survey civil war was not a reason for migration but an essential influence factor for the successful performance and application of coping strategies. Selling animals at times when everyone else sold pushed prices down and was no longer beneficial (market failure). Food and water shortages reduced the performance of the animals, many were to weak to walk to the market. For the family, the sale of animals -even when considered as a way to get money for grain -meant a loss of animal by-products such as milk or manure. Selling the last ox led to a reduction in ploughing potential and was considered as a loss in personal identity within the village. Those who had nothing to sell and were poor from before were mostly those who had no food reserves either, making their situation during drought even more precarious. The last seeds were sown often in the hope that some rain would come, wild fruits did not give enough nutrition and were far away or scarce and only the most drought resistant plant species survived. Today, based on such experiences, farmers in Tigray plant cactus fences around their home areas. As a long-term strategy, this serves as a protection of the homestead and as food reserves during drought. When modifying Figure 10. Correlation between the number of survival strategies and months until migration, calculated from the onset of the drought (see Figure 7). consumption, children suffered most, making them susceptible to diseases. At the same time the work power of the older members of society became reduced as well. Those who tried off-farm work had to compete with a hundred others for one job with meagre wage. Borrowing food was sometimes possible, but only with high interests. The 1984-85 drought in particular was felt nearly over the whole country and regional exchange could not compensate for rain failure in individual regions. The resulting famine can be described as a supply driven event, as food became scarce, as well as a demand driven event where the means of procurement (money for buying) were lacking, implying total market failure (Mortimore 1998).\\nFigure 10 illustrates the relationship of the number of survival strategies applied and the months of resisting migration after the onset of drought. The findings do not reveal an unequivocal relationship between the two variables. Still, when investigating 'extreme' cases, interesting results have been gained. Several households with some kind of non-agricultural income and animals could manage food security for up to 10 months, and did not try other survival strategies before migration. In one case, even many survival strategies could not prevent a family from migration, as the people experienced absolute lack of water, with the next well more than a fivehour walk each way! Those who continued living in their villages for two years under prevailing drought had either a large animal stock, off-farm employment, and/or tried many different survival strategies successfully. This leads to the conclusion that the value of applying coping strategies lies in its diversity and quality, which are the best insurance against the risk of famine and migration.\",\n",
       "  'Discussion and Conclusion': \"This case-study tried to enlighten the vulnerability of sedentary farmers to climate variations in dryland Ethiopia. Within the current climate change and climate impact debate, much concern has been expressed about the high vulnerability of societies in sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, there is potential for considerable impacts on food and water availability and migration behaviour. Long-term changes in climate, as well as changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events are difficult to predict, especially on a regional level. Impacts are also difficult to predict. But severe droughts in Africa are certainly not confined to the present and future. When looking back in time, human life has always been affected by climate, and in Ethiopia in particular, people have been always lived with recurrent drought and extreme climatic variability. For the next decades, studying Holocene fluctuations in climate may help in establishing the range within which changes can be expected in the short term.\\nThis paper has investigated vulnerability to climate events at household levels, by analysing migrants' behaviour and living conditions before and after the onset of previous droughts. It has been shown that at the beginning of a drought not all members of a society are equally vulnerable. Differentiation in farming yield is little in times of drought, as almost all farmers cultivate in a similar ecological setting, with little irrigation and similar technology. It is a combination of different socio-economic and environmental indicators such as animal holdings, non-agricultural income or remittances, which determines how soon problems of food shortage may begin after a scarcity of rain. Nevertheless, after a certain number of months absolute limits appear, manifested through critical food-and water deficiency, reducing the primary difference in vulnerability between households. When such a threshold was exceeded during past droughts, options in coping with the crisis disappeared, making peasant farmers, regardless of their socio-economic point of departure, equally affected and forcing many of them to migrate. Such migration reflects both the failures of the response mechanisms of the households and of the relief mechanism of the state. But one has to be aware that in societies where the level of food intake and living standard is low from before, a climatic event is simply a triggering mechanism that was latent within the system (García 1981).\\nStill, a stratification of coping strategies can prolong considerably the period of averting famine and migration after the onset of drought. People come up with a great variety of strategies. Of course, differences in creativity, motivation and choices of individuals differentiate the success of these survival strategies. The more vulnerable they were to harmful consequences of climate events initially, the fewer options they have in performing survival strategies. And vice versa, the fewer strategies they undertake after the onset of an event, the more vulnerable they become during the process, indicating a negative feedback spiral.\\nAlthough the knowledge derived in the study about people's adaptation and strength to cope with climate events might be a very useful policy tool for future planning, it is important to recognise the limitations of the predictive value of such information. Much of the information on household behaviour has to be interpreted in its location specific settings. Individual villages and regions have different factors making them more or less vulnerable to climate. This creates difficulties in aggregating and comparing information at the regional or national (Maxwell and Frankenberger 1992). At the same time, the chronology and types of survival strategies in the process of mitigating the impacts vary from place to place. Further, knowledge on past behaviour could be of less value when considering changes in crisis behaviour in the future. Riely (1991) revealed that people in the Kordofan region in Sudan with earlier drought experience changed the scope for coping with the next crisis. In a simple trial-and-error process the most successful strategies are repeated and others neglected. Resulting, even a quite accurate prediction of climate change is inadequate for deciding how serious the consequences for human societies will be (Rayner and Malone 1998). With changes in the characteristics of societies over time and space, consequences of climate change will alter simultaneously.\\nNevertheless, bearing these predictive risks in mind, dryland livelihood has been recently described as being resilient to inter-annual climate variability, rather than adjusted to an equilibrium mechanism (Mortimore 1998). People in such geographical regions have shown considerable resistance to climatic forces, where diversity in income and coping strategies are one of their main characteristics. Even if surprise of specific climate events might be the greatest challenge for assessing and adapting to future climate, historical analogies of both climate fluctuations and human response, provide a useful starting point for further impact assessment. For the future, increasing people's strength to cope with climatic crises requires a stable socio-economic and political system to enable the successful performance of survival strategies. Droughts are not preventable, but disasters are. As such, any speculative scenario of mass migration under climate change must be rejected for dryland populations whose main strategies are built on adaptation rather than on resignation. the manuscript.

First, a survey of the literature on the profile and determinants of international migration in SSA is given. Second, panel data on 45 countries spanning the period 1965 to 2005 are used to determine that the main reasons for international migration from SSA are armed conflict and lack of job opportunities. An additional year of conflict will raise net out-migration by 1.35 per 1,000 inhabitants and an additional 1 per cent growth will reduce net outmigration by 1.31 per 1,000. Demographic and environmental pressures have a less important direct impact, but a more pronounced indirect impact on migration through conflict and job opportunities. In particular, the frequency of natural disasters has a positive and significant effect on the probability that a country will experience an outbreak of armed conflict. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a 'migration hump' or of persistence in net migration rates in SSA, and no evidence that immigration is causing conflict in host countries.\",\n",

Over the last five decades economic development has stagnated in most of the continent. Africa is also the continent with the highest number of civil conflicts. It is already suffering from land degradation and freshwater scarcity, and climate change is expected to intensify these problems, causing more extreme weather conditions such as droughts and floods. 1 Therefore international migration from SSA countries can be expected to increase. Indeed, current rates of international migration from SSA are already high, and have increased dramatically in recent years.

Concerns have been voiced about the loss of skilled labour (the 'braindrain') from the already poor countries (Adepoju 2006;Clemens and Pettersson 2008) and the potential that large-scale migration results in conflict (Smith 2007;Reuveny 2007).\\nDespite this pessimistic outlook, the reasons for international migration from SSA are not fully understood. According to a recent review, 'there is a relative lack of studies on international migration in SSA' (Lucas 2006: 337). More specifically, there is a lack of empirical studies into the determinants of international migration in SSA (Konseiga 2007;Lalonde and Topel 1997). Although an obvious determinant of international migration is conflict-and SSA has the largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons 2 -not much empirical work has been done to quantify the impact of conflict on international migration. As Lucas (2006: 365) points out, existing studies only proxy the effects of conflict, and have not considered 'direct indicators of the nature, duration, and intensity' of conflict. A third omission in the literature is the environmental factors and their relative importance as determinants of migration, in particular the impact of natural disasters. There is much anecdotal evidence on the extent and future potential of 'environmentally forced migration'; however, little empirical evidence has been forthcoming on the significance and extent of 'environmental migration'.\\nThe contribution of this paper is to address these shortcomings by empirically investigating the determinants of international migration in SSA. The remainder of the paper will proceed as follows. A profile of international migration from SSA is provided in section 2. Section 3 discusses the determinants of international migration, with particular attention to economic, conflict and environmental determinants (including natural disasters). Section 4, using panel data from 1960 to 2005 on 46 countries, contains an empirical investigation into the determinants of international migration in SSA. Section 5 concludes.\\n2 Profile of international migration from SSA\",\n",
       "  'The concept and role of international migration': \"Migration has been defined as 'the relocation of people within space that involves their permanent or temporary change of residence' (Mafukidze 2006: 103). When an international border is crossed, it constitutes international migration, which can be either voluntary or forced. Voluntary migration is most often associated with entrepreneurs taking advantage of opportunities abroad, or with highly skilled and talented individuals moving to better remunerated employment opportunities elsewhere (e.g., Solimano 2007). As such, voluntary migration can be said to reflect the operation of labour markets on a global level. In contrast, forced migration is seen as the international movement of people due to desperation. When such movement is for economic reasons, as when a particular economy is in crisis, the term 'economic refugee' is sometimes used. More properly, however, the term 'refugee' refers to people migrating internationally in order to flee political violence, war, civil conflicts, and persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or political opinions. 3 When people flee violence, war, and persecution but do not cross international borders, they are internally displaced persons (IDPs). As is showed below, one of the features of migration in SSA is the high level of both refugees and IDPs.\\nInternational migration, voluntary or forced, is widely recognized to be a fundamental adjustment mechanism in global labour markets and in household survival and welfare (Hatton and Williamson 2002;Adepoju 2006;Konsiega 2007;Solimano 2007). Views differ as to the impact of migration, with some considering it to have a negative influence on the development of poor countries, reinforcing the core-periphery patterns of international development (Mafukidze 2006: 105). Other researchers consider it to be positive in general for development (Stark 2004), while still others are more cautious and believe that the impact of international migration depends on how it is managed and whether or not it is mainly skill selective (Fratesi and Riggi 2007). What is important here is to recognize that international migration may affect a country's GDP and growth, its population demographics and may have an effect on conflict (in both the sender and receiving countries) and on the pressure on natural environment.\",\n",
       "  'The extent of migration from SSA': \"Data limitations hamper an accurate assessment of migration in SSA. Existing data may underestimate its real extent (Akokpari 2000;Black 2004). Data on international migration are hampered by the fact that borders in SSA are porous, and that official statistics fail to capture informal/illegal migration (Akokpari 2000). Figure 1 depicts international migration (by the number of migrants per 1,000 inhabitants) from SSA countries over the period 1960 to 2005. As Figure 1 shows, the relative extent of migration from SSA is the most substantial from the perspective of the small island states. Hence the largest net out-migration per 1,000 takes place in Cape Verde, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Mauritius, and Sao Tomé and Principe (as well as Lesotho which, although not an island, is a small country). These small island states have generally not experienced armed conflict to the extent of some others (e.g., Mozambique and Angola), but are reckoned to be environmentally vulnerable or at risk. According to the environmental vulnerability index (EVI) of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 4 Mauritius is classified as 'highly vulnerable', Cape Verde, Comoros and Lesotho as 'vulnerable', and Equatorial Guinea and Sao Tomé and Principe as 'at risk'. Pelling and Uitto (2001) document the vulnerability of these small island states to natural disasters, identifying 65 natural disaster events that have impacted on Cape Verde, Comoros, Mauritius, and Sao Tomé and Principe between 1900 and 1997.\\nFigure 1 also shows that once size is controlled for, the extent of in-migration to South Africa is not as large as is commonly believed, and that The Gambia and Gabon experience far greater immigration per 1,000 inhabitants. These are relatively stable coastal countries, unaffected by water scarcity to the same extent as some of the countries in the region. \",\n",
       "  'Features of international migration from SSA': \"International migration from SSA countries is characterized by (i) migration flows that are very volatile, and (ii) most international migration from SSA nations is destined for other SSA countries (intra-SSA). These features are due to the impact of conflicts, seasonal weather patterns (environmental pressure) and artificial borders.\\nConsider the volatility of international migration from SSA. This can be seen in the fact that countries can alternate between net emigration to net immigration in the span of only a few years (Lucas 2006). In addition to the effects of natural disasters such as drought on the volatility of net migration, armed conflict also plays a significant role. SSA is the region with the highest number of refugees-more than 3.7 million in 2000. It is also reflected in the number of IDPs which at the end of 2006 stood at over 11 million (IDMC 2007). It is noted that once hostilities cease (as also when droughts end), refugees are quite quick to return to their countries. A further reason for the instability in migration patterns is the seasonal nature of international migration, particularly in the Sahel (Konsiega 2007).\\nMigration is also characterized in the SSA countries by the fact that most migration is confined to the continent (ECA 2006;Mafukidze 2006). One explanation is that a large proportion of the movement may be forced or seasonal migration, i.e., it is the intention of the migrants to return as soon as possible to their countries of origin. A second explanation may be the highly fragmented nature of nation-states in SSA, which has the highest number of countries per square kilometre in the world (Ndulu et al. 2007a: 102). Most of these states and their borders are highly artificial. The borders of SSA have been described as 'imposed arbitrarily, defended illogically and blamed incessantly' (Anon 1997: 17). As a result, these artificial borders may make international migration in the region seem much higher, as people do not need to travel great distances in order to be able to migrate internationally (Adepoju 2007).\",\n",
       "  'Literature review': 'In this section the literature overview of the determinants of international migration is discussed under four headings: economic determinants, demographic determinants, conflict and environmental determinants.',\n",
       "  'Economic determinants': 'In the influential model of migration by Harris and Todaro (1970), the expected net economic returns from migration drive the decision whether or not to relocate. Thus potential migrants would consider differences in wages, as well as the probability of finding employment in a possible destination. In an extension to this literature, migration is seen as strategy at the household level, as opposed to the individual level, with both push and pull factors being taken into consideration (Akokpari 2000). Push factors would typically include declines in incomes and wages, rising unemployment and poverty, and a lack of basic amenities. Pull factors generally include better access to jobs, amenities, social services and education opportunities. Economic push and pull factors are widely considered as significant determinants in SSA, due to the fact that there has been overall economic stagnation in most of the continent since the 1980s, albeit with intra-SSA differences (Mafukidze 2006;Ndulu et al. 2007b).\\nThe extent to which these economic push and pull factors eventually lead to international migration may depend on supra-national influences, including immigration laws in potential destination countries (Akokpari 2000;Myburgh 2004). These influences include the characteristics of the country, its degree of regional integration and content of its trade agreements, as well as the influence of globalization/openness.',\n",
       "  'Demographic determinants': \"Demographic determinants include the size, growth, density, and structure of a country or region's population. Population size, growth, and density are most often associated with the pressures these exert on natural resources. These may be the impetus to conflict and competition over scarce and/or valuable resources (Hatton and Williamson 2001;2002). As such, this strand of the literature also emphasizes environmental factorssuch as environmental degradation and natural hazards-as causes of international migration (Oliver-Smith 2006). These are discussed in more detail in section 3.4.\\nFor the present, however, it can be noted that the structure of the population of a country may also be an important influence on migration. In this regard, as Hatton and Williamson (2002;also Lucas 2006;Adepoju 2007) point out, it is the younger people in particular who migrate more easily for economic reasons, as they have relatively more to gain in view of their longer expected lifespan. Hatton and Williamson (2002) include in their regression analysis a measure of the number of young people in a country's demographic make-up as a determinant of international migration, and find it to be statistically very significant.\\nA further aspect of the demographics is the social networks of the population. These can facilitate international migration by providing information, reducing travel costs, and helping assimilation (Smith 2007: 621). Once international migration has started, it may build up momentum on its own. Hatton and Williamson (2002: 559) describe the persistence in migration over time as the 'friends and relatives' effect: friends and relatives create a network that facilitates migration.\",\n",
       "  'Conflict': \"It is generally accepted that political instability and armed conflict are among the most important determinants of international migration in SSA (Crisp 2006;ECA 2006;Mafukidze 2006;Adepoju 2007). Despite this recognition, very few studies so far have empirically analysed the impact of these factors on migration from SSA. In particular, none have used direct measures of political instability and conflict in relation to net migration. Using the stock of refugees in a country at the end of a particular year as dependent variable and various dummies for different types of conflict as explanatory variables, Hatton and Williamson (2001) investigate the effect of armed conflict on refugees. The authors capture the incidence of coups, guerrilla warfare, and civil wars, finding that these generate respectively 45, 30, and 64 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants.\\nTraditionally there has been less emphasis in the literature on how the consequences of international migration in SSA contribute to conflict. Recently, however, a number of authors point to the possible role of migration as a cause of conflict in destination countries (Reuveny 2007;Smith 2007). According to Reuveny (2007: 660) it is possible that environmentally forced migration is more likely to result in conflict between migrants and citizens in the destination country, because the 'scope and speed' at which it can occur (as for instance, after a natural disaster) does not allow the migrants to be 'absorbed more slowly'. Smith (2007: 629) discusses how migrants are often seen as a burden, competing for jobs, resources, or even constituting a political threat. Salehyan and Gleditsch (2006) consider the possibility that migrants may 'spread civil war', and find that the probability of violent conflict is more than three times higher in migrantreceiving countries. In section 4 a panel data model is used to determine the extent to which conflict contributes to net migration from SSA, and to investigate whether or not migration contributes to violent conflict.\",\n",
       "  'The natural environment and migration': \"Natural environment is an important, and perhaps the oldest, determinant of migration and displacement of people. It affects migration through three channels, namely through (i) scarcity of water and land, (ii) conflicts over natural resources, and (iii) natural hazards and natural disasters. Climate change is expected to intensify these three factors.\\nThere are at least ten countries in SSA where more than 50 per cent of the population is severely disadvantaged with regard to water: Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Lesotho, Namibia, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, and Swaziland. In another nine, almost a third of the population is subject to water scarcity (Le Blanc and Perez 2007). Furthermore, water scarcity has a seasonal profile with up to 25 per cent of the SSA population experiencing water stress for 10 months or more a year (Vörösmarty et al. 2004: 13). Rainfall is unpredictable/irregular in many regions of Africa and may also be on the decline 5 (Barrios, Bertinelli and Strobl 2003). 6 In addition to water scarcity, most SSA countries are faced with land degradation (Semazzi and Song 2001;Bojö 1996).\\nHow quick the migration response is to these environmental changes is uncertain. Environmental degradation often takes place slowly, leading to gradual migration. Moreover, as Reuveny (2007) points out, migration is not the only or the first response of the population to environmental degradation. People can also choose not to migrate by accepting lower living standards, or they can adjust to the environmental changes. The migration decision may depend on the ability and resources of a community to 5 Declining rainfall is predicted to have serious negative effects on development. According to Barrios, Bertinelli and Strobl (2003), using cross-country panel regression methods, declining rainfall across SSA has had a significantly negative impact on economic growth rates: they estimate that it could explain up to 36 per cent of the gap in average per capita GDP between SSA countries and other developing countries.\\n6 There are still differences among the predictions of whether and to what extent average rainfall across Africa will change due to global climate change. There is, however, more agreement, as reflected in the International Panel on Climate Change's predictions, that the continent will get warmer, and that it will experience more extreme weather conditions.\\ninnovate and adapt (resilience), as well as the frequency and intensity of natural disasters.\\nWith respect to the resilience of a community, Raleigh and Urdal (2007) find empirical evidence that water scarcity and land degradation may increase the risk of conflict, but note that these effects are 'weak' and that economic and political factors play a much more substantial role in the risk of conflict. 7 The difficultly with these findings is that conflict caused by resource scarcity may be due to inadequate institutions to mediate conflict and land degradation, so that the deep cause may not be environmental per se, but institutional (Tamas 2003). Poor SSA countries would be less able to manage potential conflict over resources than richer countries, and conflict is exacerbated in these countries by higher population growth and higher degrees of unequal access to resources (Homer-Dixon 1999; One of the major natural hazards faced by SSA countries is the highly variable and unpredictable climate patterns (Washington, Harrison and Conway 2004). Droughts are a major natural hazard: SSA had the largest concentration of droughts in the world between 1974and 2003(CRED 2004: 122): 122), affecting more than 200 million people (Reuveny 2007). The link between natural disasters and migration is stronger than the link between resource degradation and migration because often the unexpected disasters allow less time for adaptation, thus increasing the likelihood that people will migrate.\\nNatural disaster, such as a sudden drought, can also 'trigger' armed conflict in the battle for the control of natural resources (Hendrix and Glaser 2007). In section 4 empirical evidence to support this idea is given, suggesting that natural disasters can have a significant indirect effect on migration through its influence as a trigger for armed conflict.\",\n",
       "  'Empirical study': 'Having identified and discussed the most important determinants of international migration in SSA in the previous section, next I provide empirical estimates to quantify the relative impacts of these determinants on the decision to migrate.',\n",
       "  'Model': \"The economic approach to migration is based on the optimization behaviour of rational economic agents. The decision, influenced by push and pull factors, depends fundamentally on the net economic benefits from migration. The economic approach is useful when one deals with voluntary migration, but less useful when dealing with forced migration (Reuveny 2007: 658). During conflict or natural disasters, the 'traditional cost-benefit analysis of routine migration is superseded by the need for survival and/or protection of assets' (Ibánez and Vélez 2008: 659). Also, the incentive (option value) to wait, as in voluntary migration, may disappear.\\nTherefore, in order to derive a function to estimate the determinants of international migration from SSA that would allow consideration of both voluntary and forced migration, this paper follows Ibánez and Vélez (2008) who in a recent study propose a random utility model for displacement migration. They derive and test this model for internal displacement in Colombia due to violence. This model is extended here in two ways: (i) by including rapid natural environmental degradation and disaster as causes of forced migration (Ibánez and Vélez include conflict/security concerns only) and (ii) by considering international migration (they focus on internal migration only). In this regard the model derived here assumes a two-country setting: country s and country m, with households/individuals migrating both from s to m, and from m to s.\\nBasically the model states that any person or household, denoted by i, will migrate internationally if the utility from such a move exceeds the utility from remaining within a country; assume that households in country s will migrate if:\\n(1)\\nwith U im the indirect utility from migrating to country m, U is the indirect utility from not migrating and remaining in country s.\\nIn random utility models, indirect utility has a deterministic as well as random component (Ibánez and Vélez 2008). Thus the indirect utilities in (1) can be written as:\\n(2) and\\n(3) where are the random components and are the deterministic components to utility.\\nThe deterministic components reflect the main factors that individuals or households take into account when evaluating whether or not to migrate. Following the discussion in section 3, these will include relative wages or income opportunities (W im vs W is ), the costs of migration (C im ), and the household's risk aversion (R i ). When considering international migration, these costs will be affected by the fact that borders (B im ) need to be crossed. Social networks may mitigate these costs/risk aversion, which may be a function of lagged international migration (L im ). Furthermore, individuals or households will take into account political instability and violent conflict (P im vs P is ) and natural hazards (H im vs H is ). It is assumed here, based on the discussion in section 3, that longterm, gradual environment degradation and population pressure affect income opportunities, so that W is = W is (N s , P s ) with N s = environmental scarcity and D s = population size and growth. Together (N s ,D s ) reflect demographic and environmental stress in a country.\\nFollowing Ibánez and Vélez (2008) the deterministic utility function of the individual/household i in country j (j = s, m) can be written as:\\n(4)\\nThe probability of a household migration from country s is: Summing across all N-individuals/households i in country s at any given time results in total expected emigration from the country s to country m to be:\\n(6)\\nWith similar reasoning the expected emigration from country m to country s is:\\n(7)\\nIn any country j (j = s, m) the expected net rate of migration will be:\\n(8) If M j n > 0 the country j will experience net immigration (immigration exceeds emigration) and if M j n < 0, the country will experience net emigration (emigration exceeds immigration). In this paper the interest is in identifying the variables in (8) for which M j n < 0.\\nEquation ( 8) provides the basic framework for the empirical estimation in the remainder of the paper. It suggests that there are three 'groups' of time-varying determinants of net migration, namely economic opportunities and costs which include demographic and environmental stress (W, C, N, D), conflict and political variables (P) and natural environmental hazards (H). There are also time invariant determinants such as household/country fixed effects and borders (and other fixed geographical/institutional features). In the discussion on data below, the various possibilities in measuring these variables are explained.\\n(5)\",\n",
       "  'Data and estimators': '',\n",
       "  'Data': \"The variables, the data, and data sources are summarized in Table 1. The dependent variable in subsequent regressions is net migration, corresponding to Equation ( 8). Using gross migration data would have been useful, but are unavailable (Hatton and Williamson 2001). As shown in Table 1, net migration is the net total of migrants during the period, i.e., the difference between the total number of immigrants and emigrants. These data, made available by the UN Population Division, have been taken for 45 SSA countries,8 and are expressed as an annual average for the ten 5-year periods ending in 1960, 1965, 1970, 1980, 1985, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005.\\nA shortcoming in this paper that needs to be acknowledged is the quality and quantity of data, particularly on net migration. Already noted is the lack of gross migration data on the country level. The second aspect is, of course, the use of country-level data itself.\\nThe aggregated nature of migration data on a country level, and the fact that countries experience both inflow and outflows of migrants in any given year, reflecting the simultaneous push and pull factors, suggest that lower-level data, say on the household level, would be more appropriate. Third, as mentioned, there are difficulties in the accurate measurement of migration, so that the data used may not reflect the full extent of international migration. Fourth, existing data do not capture differences between short-term, temporary, or permanent migration, destination countries, nor of the composition of migrants (Lucas 2006).\\nData on the various independent variables are grouped in Table 1 according to the major types of determinants identified earlier: economic opportunities, environmental degradation and demographic pressures, political instability and conflict, natural hazards and others.\\nAs can be seen from Table 1, GDP per capita and GDP growth are used as indicators of the economic push and pull factors. GDP growth is generally used in the literature as a proxy for employment opportunities (e.g., Hatton and Williamson 2001;Lucas 2006). Furthermore, GDP per capita is postulated to be associated with a 'migration hump'; that is to say, a nonlinear relationship is assumed between the level of GDP per capita in a country and the extent of international emigration. As Lucas ( 2006) explains, at low levels of per capita income, there are fewer people who can afford to overcome the fixed costs required for international migration. However, as the development level increases, people's 'expectations, desire and ability' to migrate starts to increase (Adepoju 2007: 14). Thus a positive relationship can be expected between GDP per capita and net migration. At higher levels of per capita income, there are sufficient local opportunities for people to refrain from migrating. By including per capita GDP, we are able to test whether such a 'migration hump' exists in SSA; such evidence is currently lacking (according to Lucas 2006).\\nEnvironmental degradation and demographic pressures are measured here by the degree of water scarcity and the proportion of the country's young population (between 15 and 24 years of age), following Hatton and Williamson (2001) in the latter. In this paper the percentage of land under irrigation is (an imperfect) proxy for water scarcity. In countries with less irrigation, there are perhaps less water resources available, and thus also a greater dependency on rainfall. Other possible indicators, such as the water stress index (see Ohlsson 1999) or the EVI (of SOPAC) were also considered, but these  -year periods 1960-65, 1965-70, 1970-75, 1975-80, 1980-85, 1985-90, 1990-95, 1995-2000, 2000- indicators are only available for a single year-and were not found to induce any improvement in the results.\\nPopulation density is a potentially important determinant that not only affects economic opportunities but results in environmental stress. Following from the discussion in section 3, population density can therefore be seen as a proxy for land scarcity (Raleigh and Urdal 2007) and real wage pressure (higher population density can reduce wages) (Hatton and Williamson 2001). Potential problems exist in using population variables in a regression model on net migration: first, population variables are not likely to be endogenous. In other words, migration is likely to affect population variables, so that there is likely to be strong bi-directional causality between the variables. This consideration, as well as the fact that the UN Population division makes use of population growth patters in estimating net migration rates, 9 has influenced the decision not to use population growth rates in this paper as an independent variable in the regression analysis.\\nAs far as political instability and conflict determinants are concerned, Table 1 shows that these are measured directly by the number of years during the 5-year period that were characterized by armed conflict (as measured by more than 25 battle-related deaths). It is generally accepted that armed conflict is an important determinant of outmigration, and one would expect to find a significantly negative relationship between violent conflict and net migration in the sample.\\nThe effects of being subjected to natural hazards are measured here by the number of natural disasters that have taken place in a country during the period, but bearing in mind that not all natural hazards inevitably result in natural disasters. The data are taken from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). It does not measure the intensity of the disaster in terms of either physical or monetary damages caused, or in terms of casualties. Whilst these are important, the frequency of disasters may be more important from the point of permanent emigration rather than once-off large disasters.\\nFinally, Table 1 indicates that a category of 'other' variables is also applied in the regression analysis, which includes whether or not a country is landlocked. People in landlocked countries may have greater difficulties in migrating internationally, if the aim is to migrate out of Africa. Also, to the extent that landlocked SSA countries may be experiencing more economic and environmental difficulties, migration from landlocked to coastal countries may be significant.\",\n",
       "  'Estimating equation and estimators': \"Given that panel data methods are to be used, the implicit Equation ( 8) can be written in the following more explicit form:\\nit i it it u c x m + + = β (9)\\n9 There is a very strong positive linear relationship between population growth rates and net migration rates in the sample. The correlation coefficient between these is 0.81.\\nFor i = 1,…N and t = 2,…T and where m it = net migration from country i over period t;\\nx it = a 1×K vector of explanatory variables which includes the variables set out in Table 1. As indicated in that table, some of these vary over t; c i = unobserved country characteristics that are constant over the time period, and influence m it ; and u it = a random error term with the usual properties.\\nThe preferred estimator in this case is a dynamic panel data estimator, specifically the 'system GMM' estimator. This is because such an estimator allows one to deal with three issues which complicate the analysis with typical linear estimators such as OLS and 2SLS in the present case. First, one can expect important country-specific effects (c i ) to operate, which may cause omitted variable bias. Second, as was clear from the discussion in sections 2 and 3, the relationship between net migration and some of its expected determinants is complex, with the possibility of reverse causality. For instance, while population pressure can lead to out-migration, its very occurrence may act as a valve to relieve population pressure in a subsequent period. Similarly, net migration may affect economic opportunities by influencing GDP growth through changes in skilled labour. Third, migration is a dynamic process. In the case of SSA, it was noted that past levels of migration may influence current levels because of either persistence effects (networks, or 'family and friends') or instability (returning migrants). To allow for these factors, it is necessary to include lagged values of net migration in the estimation equation.\\nTo show how the system GMM (generalized method of moments) estimator can be used, Equation ( 9) can be re-written in dynamic format as the following AR(1) model:\\nit i it it t it it it u c x m m m m + + + + = Δ = - - - β α γ ' 1 1 (10)\\nThis can be written more conveniently as:\\nit i it it t it u c x m m + + + + + = - β α γ ' 1 ) 1 ((11)\\nwhere Δm it = the difference in net migration over the period and γ t = period-specific intercept terms, and u it as defined earlier.\\nTaking first-differences of (11) gets rid of the time-invariant components, c i which addresses the problem of omitted variable bias:\\nit it it t it u x m m Δ + Δ + Δ + + = Δ - β α γ ' 1 ) 1 ((12)\\nHowever, first differencing (11) introduces a further problem as it will result in the regressors becoming correlated with the error term (for instance Δm it-1 depends on u it-1 ).\\nTo avoid this, instrumental variables need to be used for the endogenous regressors. Arellano and Bond (1991) propose using the lagged levels of the regressors (e.g., m it-j ) as instruments to avoid endogeneity-and derive a 'difference' GMM-estimator.\\nSubsequently it has been shown that when the number of time periods used is relatively small, the lagged levels of the regressors might not be good instruments for differenced variables, especially if the latter follows a random walk (e.g., Bond, Hoeffler and Temple 2001). Following contributions from Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998), it has now become standard to use a 'systems' GMM estimator which adds to the difference equation in ( 12) a further equation in levels, with the instruments in first differences. The system-GMM estimator therefore consists of estimating both (11) (which is in levels), using lagged differences (e.g., Δm it-j ) as instruments, and (12) (which is in first-differences), using lagged levels (e.g., m it-j ) as instruments (see Arellano and Bover 1995;Blundell and Bond 1998). A benefit of this systems-equation approach as opposed to the 'difference GMM' estimator is that one can now include time-invariant regressors which would otherwise by differenced out (Roodman 2006).\",\n",
       "  'Regression results': \"Table 2 contains the 'system GMM' regression results. It can be seen from the diagnostics that the overall specification seems to be sound. The number of instruments does not exceed the number of groups, the Sargan test for over-identifying restrictions on the instruments cannot reject the null that these restrictions are valid, and the Arellano-Bond test cannot reject the null of no second-order autocorrelation. Furthermore, Table 2 reports both the normal z-values (column 2), the z-values obtained from estimating robust standard errors (column 3) and the coefficients from the two-step system-GMM estimator (column 4). The results in Table 2 show that the variables which are consistently significant across columns 2 to 4 are the past levels of net migration, GDP growth, and armed conflict. Population density is significant when the one-step (non-robust) estimator is used, and so is natural disasters when the two-step estimator is used. The signs on the coefficients are as expected.\\nThe results in Table 2 suggest that in forced migration, conflict and the quest for job opportunities are the most significant determinants of international migration in SSA. Armed conflict and GDP growth have the greatest impact on international migration, with the sizes of their respective impacts roughly similar. An additional year of conflict will raise net out-migration by 1.35 per 1,000 inhabitants while an additional 1 per cent growth will reduce net out-migration by 1.31 per 1,000. The latter results show the importance of taking lags into consideration: without lagged GDP growth, the impact of an additional 1 per cent growth on migration is only around 0.8 per 1,000, which is closer to other estimates in the literature (e.g., Hatton and Williamson 2001) where static estimation methods are used.\\nPast levels of migration have a significant influence on current levels. The fact that the sign on lagged migration is negative suggests a situation where there is cyclical or return migration rather than persistence in international migration flows. This confirms the patterns of volatility of international migration in SSA. It is also consistent with migration that is mainly forced. It can also be noted that GDP per capita is insignificant and enters with a positive sign, implying the absence of a 'migration hump' in SSA.\\nPopulation density is only significant in column 2 and has a negative (but relatively small) impact on net migration. Given the discussion in section 3, this is as expected. The reason for the negative coefficient on population density could reflect either lower relative wages, and/or population pressure on resources. Both reasons would result in a negative coefficient.\\nOverall, the results in Table 2 support the widely shared view that international migration from SSA is largely forced in nature, due in particular to armed conflict and political instability. It also supports the notion that economic and demographic factors lead to high rates of mainly voluntary migration. The role of natural hazards and more gradual environmental degradation and pressure on natural resources are more difficult to discern. Natural disasters enter with the right sign, but the coefficient just misses being statistically significant at the 10 per cent level when using the one-step estimator. Under the two-step estimator, the impact of natural disasters, however, is significant. Proxies for water scarcity (land under irrigation) and for being landlocked are consistently negative. Using direct measures such as the water stress index or the EVI also turns out to be insignificant. To the extent that population density is found to be negatively associated with net migration, it may be an indication that resource scarcity can matter. However, the coefficient on population density is small, so that one may conclude that unless natural disasters, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity substantially affect either conflict or job opportunities, their impact on emigration from SSA countries is not likely to be substantial.\\nFinally, some further remarks on the relationship between natural disasters, environmental degradation and resource scarcity and international migration are in order. As was mentioned, there is only slight indication from Table 2 that natural disasters may have an influence on migration in SSA. It is statistically significant in the shown in Table A1, the net migration rate (lagged here to avoid problems of reverse causality) has no significant affect on conflict.\\nFinally, the effects of natural disasters, environmental degradation and resource scarcity on GDP growth (which is generally seen as a proxy for job opportunities) in SSA are estimated. The detailed results (not reported here for the sake of brevity) find that the effect of the environmental variables on GDP growth is generally insignificant. Only the number of natural disasters is noted to be statistically significant with a one-period lag. Once institutions, geography and conflict are controlled for, the only environmental variable noted to be significant is the amount of arable land. This means that decreases in arable land, for instance through soil degradation, will lead to a decline in GDP growth. It is also observed that armed conflict has a statistically significant negative contemporaneous association with GDP growth, consistent with bi-directional causality between conflict and GDP growth. Finally, no evidence is found to suggest that migration has a statistically significant impact on GDP growth in SSA.\",\n",
       "  'Concluding remarks': \"SSA already has the world's highest population of refugees, the second highest population of migrants, and the highest rate of growth in international migration. In this paper empirical evidence is presented to suggest that conflict and the quest for job opportunities are the most significant determinants of international migration in SSA. Specifically, armed conflict and GDP growth have the largest impacts on international migration. The sizes of their respective impacts are comparable: an additional year of conflict will raise net out-migration by 1.35 per 1,000 inhabitants and an additional 1 per cent growth will reduce net out-migration by 1.31 per 1,000. The size of the latter effect is significantly higher than the effect found earlier, for instance, by Hatton and Williamson (2001). Environmental factors are also important. It is noted that one additional natural disaster per year can lead to an increase in net out-migration of 0.6 per 1,000. Apart from population density, which can be perceived to reflect the pressure on resources, other determinants related to environmental degradation and resource scarcity, such as irrigation, and water stress/environmental vulnerability index are not found to be significant.\\nIt has to be emphasized that disentangling the separate effects of these reasons for international migration is difficult. They interact in complex ways. Thus it is established that environmental variables affect conflict and job opportunities (GDP growth), and that conflict affects GDP growth. Specifically, the number of natural disasters in a country raises its probability of civil war. This is consistent with the view that natural disasters can act as a 'trigger' in the conflict over scarce resources. Also, in the absence of controlling variables, natural disasters are noted to have a negative impact on GDP growth, but with a period lag. Reductions in arable land, as would occur due to soil degradation, are also noted to depress GDP growth. The main impact of environment factors on migration from SSA countries can thus be said to occur through their impact on conflict and economic growth.\\nFinally, what policy implications emanate from these findings? First, it has to be acknowledged by policymakers that international migration in SSA is both an adapting and mitigating strategy in the face of conflicts, natural disasters, and economic stagnation. Governments in recipient SSA countries should formulate strategies to better accommodate the inflows so as not to worsen the plight of people who have been largely forced to migrate.\\nSecond, if confrontation can be limited further and if the continent can reverse its economic stagnation, the rate of out-migration from SSA countries will be reduced or perhaps even turned around-without significant efforts by governments to entice migrants back.\\nThird, SSA's growing (and predominantly young) population is putting pressure on the natural environment. Furthermore, global climate change is likely to lead to an increase in the frequency of natural hazards. It is noted here that both of these factors can fuel conflict, depress economic growth, and subsequently raise emigration. One policy response, also advocated by Le Blanc and Perez (2007), would be to attempt to reduce population growth. A further option is to reduce and reverse the extent of land degradation. More generally, however, policymakers, donors and the international development agencies should take care to strengthen state capacity and invest in building community resilience in SSA that could contribute towards reducing the likelihood of natural hazards developing into natural disasters.\",\n",
       "  '': \"two-step estimator, with a coefficient size that suggests that one additional natural disaster per year could lead to an increase in net out-migration of 0.6 per 1,000. Apart from population density, which can be seen as reflecting pressure on resources, other determinants related to environmental degradation and resource scarcity, such as irrigation, and water stress/environmental vulnerability index (not reported) are not found to be significant. However, these variables may affect conflict and job opportunities (GDP growth) and, as such, have an indirect impact on migration. In the Appendix further regression results are reported to investigate these potential channels, which confirm that natural disasters act as a trigger for conflict in SSA, and that natural disasters and reduced arable land may depress economic growth.\\nThe Appendix includes two tables: Appendix Table A1 presents the results of a probit regression for the determinants of whether or not a country will experience conflict in a given year. The dependent variable is constructed as a dummy variable which is equal to 1 if a country experienced armed conflict in a particular year, and 0 if otherwise. Appendix Table A2 contains the system GMM results of the determinants of the number of years of conflict (intensity) in SSA. The independent variables in these regressions are based on the conflict in SSA literature (e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998;Welsch 2008). Thus in addition to natural disasters, these regressions include variables such as GDP, GDP growth, ethnic fractionalization (using the index in Alesina et al. 2003) and in the case of the probit regression, the EVI of a country (the proportion of land under irrigation is also used alternatively, but this turned out to be insignificant as in the system GMM estimation). Moreover, the variables applied in the regression results reported in the Appendix include the rate of net migration to test for the possibility that migration may influence conflict in a country.\\nThe results in the Appendix show that in the outbreak of armed conflict, a probit regression finds that GDP per capita, ethnic fractionalization and the number of natural disasters are the most significant explanatory variables. Countries with a higher GDP per capita will have less probability of civil war; conversely countries with higher degree of ethnic fractionalization have a higher probability. These results are consistent with the extensive literature on civil conflict in SSA. What is novel in the case of the present results is the significant influence of natural disasters. Thus, as shown in Appendix Table A1, the number of natural disasters in a country raises its probability of being in civil war. This may be consistent with the hypothesis discussed in section 3 that natural disasters can act as a 'trigger' for conflict over scarce resources. From Appendix Table A1 the elasticity can be calculated: this indicates that an additional one disaster per annum (the average in the sample is 3.6) raises the probability that the country can fall into civil conflict by 1.75 per cent.\\nAppendix Table A2 shows that as far as the intensity of civil conflict is concerned (measured by the number of years of conflict), GDP growth reduces the intensity of conflict, and conflict in the previous year (lagged conflict) prolongs it (i.e., there is some persistence). Being landlocked also raises the duration of a country's conflict. One explanation for the significance of the landlocked variable is that it may reflect the fact that if institutions are lacking and conflict over natural resources do take place, it has a particularly detrimental impact on countries with a 'low degree of openness', such as Africa's landlocked nations (Arezki and Van der Ploeg 2007). Furthermore, Appendix Table A2 indicates that the number of disasters does not affect the duration/intensity of conflict, supporting the notion of natural disasters as the 'trigger' for conflict.

       "  'Introduction': \"It is generally accepted that environmental change can influence human migration (Foresight, 2011;Adger et al., 2014); this process is called environment-induced migration. In drylands, migration is a commonly used strategy to cope with environmental change, as the natural resource basedwhich is highly susceptible to climate changedlargely determines the livelihood of rural populations. Drylands cover approximately 40% of the Earth's land surface and has more than 2 billion inhabitants, 90% of whom are located in developing countries (IIED, 2008). Today, more than half of the world's impoverished live in drylands (IIED, 2008;Safriel & Adeel, 2005). Hunger-and poverty-related vulnerability are likely to increase in drylands as a result of environmental changes such as land degradation, increasing variability of rainfall, chronic water shortage, and an increasing frequency of droughts (IIED, 2008;Sissoko, Keulen, Verhagen, Tekken, & Battaglini, 2011;van der Geest & Dietz, 2004). These environmental changes are recognized as potential drivers of out-migration and are acknowledged to contribute to the migration of large numbers of people (Foresight, 2011;IOM, 2008a).\\nSince the 1980s, after a period of neglect, the interest in migration-driving environmental factors has been growing (Piguet, 2012). Recently, an increasing number of scholars used theoretical frameworks to acknowledge the complex role that environmental change plays in migration processes (Black et al., 2011;McLeman & Smit, 2006;Perch-Nielsen, B€ attig, & Imboden, 2008). These frameworks extend beyond the simple assumption that adverse environmental conditions straightforwardly cause migration. Moreover, a growing number of case studies illustrate that migration can be a valuable climate adaptation strategy to improve livelihoods in drylands (Brockhaus, Djoudi, & Locatelli, 2013;McLeman & Hunter, 2010;McLeman & Smit, 2006;Meze-Hausken, 2000;Roncoli, Ingram, & Kirshen, 2001;Scheffran, Marmer, & Sow, 2012). However, analytical and spatially explicit studies regarding the interaction between environmental change and human migration are relatively rare. Studies that empirically explore relationships between environmental pressure and human migration in drylands are typically restricted to particular stress factors in selected regions, for example, droughts in Ethiopia (Gray & Müller, 2012), vegetation changes in Ghana ( Van der Geest, Vrieling, & Dietz, 2010), or changes in rainfall patterns in Burkina Faso (Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004). However, there is a general paucity of integrated analyses of the interplay between multiple environmental pressures and human migration at the macro-scale. Moreover, systematic large-scale projects that employ a consistent and comparable approach at several sites are rare and meta-studies are virtually missing (Piguet, P ecoud, & de Guchteneire, 2011). In addition, there is a lack of insight regarding the mechanisms that lead to environment-induced migration. As a result, no globally consistent picture of the environmental drivers of human migration in drylands has emerged.\\nGiven the caveat that environmental factors are only one of many factors that can potentially drive migration, here we present a global-scale approach used to analyse spatial patterns of environmental drivers of human migration in drylands, and we link these drivers to observed hotspots of out-migration. To achieve this objective, we applied a cluster analysis to spatially explicit global data (Janssen, Walther, & Lüdeke, 2012). Cluster analysis is a commonly used statistical method to classify observations based on their similarity. Our results reveal that environmental constraints in drylands can be grouped into eight distinct clusters, and the most distinctive indicators are related to water and land availability. These clusters can be used to better characterise regions of outmigration in drylands and to understand some of the dynamics that underlie out-migration.\",\n",
       "  'Drivers of migration': \"A broad range of terms and concepts are generally used to classify migration that results from environmental factors (IOM, 2008b). These concepts all draw on the classical migration theory of push and pull factors (Lee, 1966) by assigning relatively high importance to push factors that are linked to environmental conditions at the place of origin. However, environmental change is rarely the sole cause of out-migration, as migration usually occurs in a broader socio-economic and political context. Ifdand howdenvironmental change triggers migration can also depend on political, economic, and demographic constraints at various scales; therefore, measuring and isolating 'pure' environment-induced migration and making generalisation regarding the causes and consequences of migration is challenging (Black et al., 2011;De Haas, 2010;Richmond, 1995;Suhrke, 1993). Consequently, estimates of the current and future numbers of environmental migrants vary widely (Gemenne, 2011). Moreover, the individual's expectations with respect to the benefits of migrationdas well as the resulting financial and psychological costsdcan affect the individual's decision whether to migrate or not. Here, we focus on migration that is linked to a gradual decline in environmental conditions within the context of population growth, low agricultural productivity, poverty, and fragile ecosystems (IOM, 2008b).\\nBuilding on the work of Black et al. (2011), we distinguished the following six interrelated categories of macro-level drivers of migration in drylands: political factors, demographic factors, economic factors, social factor, environmental factors, and food security (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, in our analysis, we only account for environmental drivers, as reliable global grid cell data regarding the other categories of drivers in drylands are scarce. Political drivers of migration include governance types, conflicts, security, discrimination, and persecution as well as formalised resettlement programmes and/or policies. Economic drivers include technological development, investments, employment opportunities, income levels, and market integration. Economic and political drivers interact at various levels; for example, large-scale infrastructure programmes designed to stimulate economic development usually fall under the umbrella of national or sub-national governmentbased strategic development programmes and policies. Although economic development often attracts immigrants, it is usually impossible to attribute the resulting in-migration solely to either political or economic factors, as these factors are usually closely related. In contrast, an economic crisis can trigger political instability, thereby potentially causing a change in the political system and possible out-migration. Demographic drivers include population structure, growth, and the occurrence of diseases, all of which can depend strongly on the economic and/or political context. For example, to successfully curtail diseases such as malaria and HIV, providing health education programmes and access to medical care is essential. Typically, such programmes are part ofdor are excluded fromdthe national health policy, which illustrates the tight relationship between demographic and political drivers. Furthermore, demographic drivers can determine economic development via mechanisms such as education, labour availability, and labour force. Environmental drivers of migration include rapid-onset changes (such as floods and hurricanes) as well as slowonset changes, which include land degradation, desertification, and changes in climate variability. Both the severity and frequency of such environmental drivers are likely to be affected by global environmental change, which is considered to bedat least in partda consequence of complex socio-economic changes that have been developing for decades. Food security is closely related to the other four categories of drivers (political, demographic, economic, and environmental) and plays a central role in migration. Therefore, food security is a function of agricultural production, investments in food production technologies, infrastructure for food storage and distribution, population pressure, trade policies, food prices, and political stability. The perceived and actual differences between the place of origin and the destination with respect to one or more of the illustrated drivers can influence whether people choose to migrate or not. In addition, social factorsdincluding family obligations, culture, and access to migration networksdcan influence an individual's decision of whether or not to migrate. \",\n",
       "  'Data and methods': '',\n",
       "  'Environmental drivers': 'In our statistical analysis, we explicitly focussed on environmental drivers of migration, given the limited availability of global grid cell data regarding non-environmental drivers. We used spatially explicit information of potential environmental drivers of out-migration. Based on Fig. 1, we selected the following seven indicators (these indicators are elaborated below): annual mean precipitation, aridity, drought frequency, land degradation, soil constraints, cropland, and pasture area (Table 1).\\nIncreasing water scarcity is seen to be a major driver of migration in drylands (McLeman & Hunter, 2010;Mehta, 2007;Meze-Hausken, 2000). Water availability in drylands is determined primarily by the quantity and distribution of precipitation during the crop-growing period and by aridity. To cover the various dimensions of water availability, we included three complementary waterrelated indicators in our analysis. We used the mean annual precipitation for the year 2000 based on CRU data (Mitchell & Jones, 2005). Precipitation can be used as an indicator of water supply without specifying how much of the precipitation is available for the fauna and flora. To account for the portion of precipitation that is directly available for plants only, precipitation must be corrected for evapotranspiration. This correction is usually performed by relating precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (PET) in order to derive the aridity index. For our analysis, we obtained data regarding global aridity from the CGIAR Consortium (Trabucco & Zomer, 2009), who derived aridity information by integrating monthly mean precipitation data from the CRU together with simulated PET data (Mitchell & Jones, 2005). Because our goal was to focus solely on arid regions, we excluded all dry sub-humid regions (i.e. all regions with an aridity index >0.5) from our analysis. A high aridity index reflects low aridity. Together, the precipitation and aridity indicators reflect the average conditions for the year 2000. To account for long-term variability in the water supply, we calculated a drought frequency indicator for the period 1970 through 2000 to capture changes in annual precipitation variability within a given year. To calculate this indicator, we calculated annual precipitation variability using monthly precipitation data from the CRU (Mitchell & Jones, 2005). Annual precipitation variability is the degree of deviation of the annual value derived from the 31-year mean divided by the 31-year standard deviation (Marchiori, Maystadt, & Schumacher, 2012). Using annual precipitation variability, we determined whether each year was significantly drier or wetter than the other 30 years in the time period. Adding up all of the particularly dry years provided an approximation of drought frequency.\\nWorldwide, drylands comprise 44% of cultivated land and support 50% of all livestock (UNCCD, 2013). Thus, in addition to water availability, land and soil conditions essentially determine the livelihood of the local population. To represent soil constraints, we used information on soil and terrain limitations from IIASA/FAO (2012). This dataset combines information regarding soil nutrient availability, soil nutrient retention capacity, soil rooting conditions, soil oxygen availability, soil toxicities, soil salinity and sodicity conditions, and soil management constraints in a soil constraints rating. In addition to soil constraints, we also included land degradation, which is often identified as a major driver of increasing vulnerability and human migration in drylands (Grote & Warner, 2010). In addition to climate change, the principal drivers of land degradation include overgrazing, erosion, deforestation, unsustainable agricultural intensification, and urbanisation (Bowyer et al., 2009). In accordance with Bai, Conijn, Bindraban, and Rutgers (2012), we define land degradation as a disturbance-driven, longterm loss of land productivity from which the land cannot recover without assistance. Because land degradation can be measured as the change in net primary productivity (NPP) over time, we used NPP change estimates based on remote-sensing Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series as a proxy for land degradation (Conijn, Bai, Bindraban, & Rutgers, 2013). The NDVI data are based on fortnightly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) measurements (Tucker, Pinzon, & Brown, 2004) that were aggregated to an annual scale (Bai et al., 2012).\\nTo capture land scarcity and the intensity of agricultural production in our analysis, we used the extent of cropland and pasture land from Ramankutty, Evan, Monfreda, and Foley (2008). These data reflect a complex interplay between issues related to climate, accessibility, and legislation (including property rights and land usability), which together determine whether or notdand the degree to whichda specific plot of land is used for pasture or cropping. In the subsequent analyses, we excluded all grid cells that were covered by !75% cropland and for which !75% was equipped with irrigation facilities (Siebert et al., 2005;Siebert, Hoogeveen, & Frenken, 2006). For these grid cells, we hypothesised that agricultural production is intense and therefore less vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions relative to the cropland that was included in the analysis. In total, we included approximately 17,000 grid cells with a spatial resolution of 0.5 in our analysis. Prior to our analysis we normalised all indicators to the zero to one range according to their minimum and maximum values among all grid cells to allow for comparability of indicator values (see Eq. ( 1)).\\nI x; 0 to 1 ¼ I x À I min I max À I min\\n(1) \\nI ¼ Indicator x ¼ Grid cell I x, 0 to 1 ¼ Grid cell x normalized to range 0e1 I min ¼ Minima among all grid cells I max ¼ Maxima among all grid cells',\n",
       "  'Cluster analysis': \"The goal of our study was to describe the spatial pattern of environmental migration incentives at the global level using cluster analyses. Cluster analysis is a statistical method that classifies observations into groups (so-called 'clusters') by calculating similarities amongst all observations using a measure of distance. Observations within a given cluster (intra-cluster observations) are more similar to each other than to observations in other clusters (inter-cluster observations).\\nTo perform the cluster analyses, we used the software environment R (see http://cran.r-project.org), a versatile open-source environment with extensive statistical functionality for data analysis, calculation, and graphical display. The cluster analysis was performed in two steps as described by Janssen et al. (2012) to account for (1) effects of initialisation and (2) to select the appropriate number of clusters:\\n(1) The common k-means cluster algorithm was applied to the complete indicator dataset, which consisted of the abovedescribed seven environmental indicators for all dryland grid cells (~17,000 cells). This algorithm is initialised by performing a hierarchical cluster analysis on a small random subset of this dataset comprising 300 of the ~17,000 dryland grid cells. To obtain an initial provisional impression of the effects of initialisation, this first step was performed twice by generating an extra initial random subset (comprised of 300 grid cells) and again performing hierarchical clustering on this new random subset.\\nThus, two sets of cluster centres resulted from this randomly repeated hierarchical clustering step, and each of these sets was subsequently used as a random starting point for the k-means clustering of the complete dataset. As a consequence of this approach, we generated two cluster partitions of the complete dataset; comparing this pair of partitions provided information regarding the robustness/consistency of the clustering procedure. For this pairwise comparison, the partitions were established by counting the number of grid cells that are allocated to the same cluster in each of this pair and then dividing this number by the total number of grid cells in order to obtain the consistency measure, which is a measure of reproducibility and which illustrates the inherent sensitivity of the k-means clustering for initializations.\\n(2) This pairwise comparison was performed a total of 200 times to obtain a more robust/accurate estimate of this reproducibility measure, thus providing an estimate of the average consistency as well as other key statistics (e.g. variance, quartiles, etc.). Moreover, this repetitive search produced 400 clustering partitions, each from another (random) initialization, and from these 400 partitions the partition with the lowest inner cluster variance was chosen as a candidate optimal partition. Repeated trials of this procedure rendered the same 'optimal' partition for each cluster number k considered, thus illustrating the robustness of this partition.\\nThis procedure can also be used to select the 'optimal' number of clusters (the 'optimal' k). By performing this repetitive pairwise comparison procedure using various cluster numbers k (e.g. k ¼ 2, …, k max ) and then calculating the average consistency for each k, the k-values for which the average consistency is highest will be good candidates for the optimal number of clusters.\\nCluster analyses are frequently used to map spatial patterns of specific conditions. In particular, environmental conditions are often grouped using a cluster analysis; for example, to create land cover maps based on satellite data (Kerr & Cihlar, 2003;Yang & Lo, 2002) or to map patterns of climate change (Mahlstein & Knutti, 2010). Cluster analyses can also be used to identify the spatial interactions between humans and their environment, as well as the consequences of these interactions. For example, Ellis and Ramankutty (2008), Letourneau, Verburg, and Stehfest (2012), van Asselen and Verburg (2012), and V aclavík, Lautenbach, Kuemmerle, and Seppelt (2013) used cluster analyses to map global distinct land use systems by combining environmental date with socio-economic data. In addition, Sietz, Lüdeke, and Walther (2011) and Kok et al. (2010, accepted) identified global patterns of vulnerability of both drylands and forests to environmental change by accounting for gross domestic product (GDP), infant mortality, road density, water stress, soil degradation, and natural agroconstraints. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used cluster analysis to spatially describe environmental drivers of human out-migration.\",\n",
       "  'Global hotspots of negative net-migration in drylands': 'Given the complexity of the migration processes, quantifying the number of migrants at the global level is a major challenge. The Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIE-SIN) made such an attempt by mapping migration spatially explicit at the grid cell level over the entire globe (CIESIN, 2011;Sherbinin et al., 2012). Facing the absence of globally accurate migration data at subnational level the authors used indirect estimation methods combining time series of population maps with subnational data regarding birth and death rates to obtain net-migration rates. The resulting net-migration is the grid cell-specific, quantitative difference between in-migration and out-migration. Here, for the purposes of this study, we define negative net-migration as outmigration; the actual out-migration flow might be even higher if in-migration also occurs within the same period. There are a number of uncertainties related to the indirect estimation method, which are largely associated with the assumed relationship between population density and natural increase, the utilized census data, anddmost likely causing the biggest uncertaintiesdthe approach to impute rates of natural increase (CIESIN, 2011). The net-migration maps were validated in a way that the sum of netmigration at the national level equals estimates of the 2008 World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2009). In addition, for China and the US CIESIN (2011) compared the simulated netmigration results with net-migration rates from alternative county-level data and concluded a reasonably good correlation between the simulated and alternate net-migration rates. However, evaluating the subnational spatial patterns of net-migration for all countries was not possible, as true measures of net-migration were not available for comparison (CIESIN, 2011).\\nWe used the global map of negative net-migration for the period from 1990 through 2000 (Fig. 2), which we linked to the cluster results to discuss their applicability. Accordingly, we calculated the average negative net-migration per square kilometre for each cluster in order to explore cluster-specific migration patterns. Finally, we selected two hotspots of negative net-migration and discuss the most important environmental and non-environmental constraints (as determined by the published literature) in order to evaluate the identified clusters.',\n",
       "  'Results': 'Spatially, the environmental drivers of migration vary widely. To identify large-scale regions containing similar environmental drivers, we performed a cluster analysis using spatially explicit data. This analysis allowed us to identify the most pressing environmental conditions (per grid cell and region) that potentially contribute to out-migration. In doing so, we could distinguish regions that are characterised primarily by land-related drivers of out-migration from regions that are characterised primarily by water-related drivers of migration. For example, the two clusters that had the highest population densities and the largest crop land extent (namely, the \"Little water scarcity\" and \"Cropping\" clusters) had high land degradation and the lowest water scarcity among all eight clusters. We therefore argue that within these two clusters, land degradation is a stronger determinant of out-migration than water. Given their high population density and cropping activities, these clusters are particularly vulnerable to increasing land degradation and food insecurity. In contrast, water scarcity (expressed in terms of aridity, precipitation, and drought frequency) is the highest in the desert clusters (\"Desert with moderately constrained soils\" and \"Desert with highly constrained soils\"). Viewing these two clusters in the context of potential absolute migration flows may not be particularly relevant, given the low population density and nomadic culture typical of desert regions.\\nOn the other hand, the interaction of socio-political and environmental factors in migration processes in these two clusters is significant. For example, in Northern Mali the advance of extremist Muslim groups and Al-Qaida recently triggered migration of people both internally in Mali and to neighbouring countries. Particularly in Mali, the displaced civilians are distributed across arid areas contributing to food insecurity and tensions among the various communities, which potentially triggers new migration flows (UNHCR, 2014). This example emphasises the important role that socio-political factorsdthrough their interplay with environmental factorsdplay in influencing migration. Given the relatively high frequency of political upheaval in drylands (particularly in Africa), there might be a correlation between fragile environmental conditions, the specific demographic profile and the relatively low level of government involvement in these areas that results from these environmental and demographic conditions.\\nWe found that in particular regions, a specific combination of environmental factors goes hand-in-hand with a high rate of negative net-migration. For example, our results suggest that both high absolute and high relative rates of negative net-migration occur most often in the \"Little water scarcity\" cluster that covers the southern regions of the Sahel, the more semi-arid regions of Southern Africa, Northeast Brazil, and the Argentinian and Paraguayan pampas. This cluster is therefore more prone to outmigration than other clusters. However, identifying the extent to which the observed negative net-migration can be related directly to cluster-specific environmental constraints is difficult, as the applied migration data do not specify the reasons for migration. Other factors (including non-environmental factors) that were not considered in our analysis have likely triggered migration as well. Our findings are further supported by the results of the hotspot analyses, which illustrate the complexity of environmental and non-environmental factors in migration processes. Given the combination of high negative net-migration rates together with the identified environmental constraints, we argue that the most pressing environmental factors driving this clusterdincluding land degradationdhave contributed to the observed out-migration in the respective regions.',\n",
       "  'Spatial patterns of environmental incentives for human migration': 'The presented clusters (see Fig. 3) are a spatial expression of the environmental stressors that potentially cause migration as identified and highlighted by numerous case studies and reports. The cluster algorithm revealed that the optimal cluster number is eight, which provides the most robust results in terms of high average consistency measure. The variability of the indicator values for each cluster is illustrated in Fig. 4.\\nWe identified two desert clusters extending from the Sahara to the Arabian Peninsula and Central Asia. Both of these clusters have high aridity, low precipitation, and the highest drought frequency amongst all clusters. Cropping and grazing are relatively low in both clusters, reflecting the regions\\' harsh environmental conditions. Nevertheless, soil constraints vary between these clusters. The \"Desert with highly constrained soils\" cluster has more severe soil constraints than the \"Desert with moderately constrained soils\" cluster and represents the interior of deserts.\\nAmong all of the eight clusters, the \"Little water scarcity\" cluster has the least water scarcity. Precipitation is the highest in the \"Little water scarcity\" cluster, whereas aridity and drought frequency are amongst the lowest. Both cropping and grazing are practiced, with grassland having a larger extent than cropland. The \"Little water scarcity\" cluster is characterised by land degradation. This cluster primarily occurs at the South of the Sahel towards the more semihumid regions, Northeast Brazil and along the Argentinian and Paraguayan pampas. The \"Grazing under water constraints\" cluster is a grazing cluster that is widely distributed but primarily occurs in Central Asia, Eastern Australia, South of Argentina, and the Sahara. Water resources are relatively scarce in this cluster, and this scarcity is reflected by high aridity and low precipitation. Unlike all other clusters that include cropping and grazing activities, land degradation is largely absent in this cluster.\\nThe \"Grazing under low soil constraints\" cluster is characterised by high levels of grazing activities and low levels of cropping activities. Environmental constraints can be attributed primarily to land characteristics rather than to water availability. This cluster includes vast regions in Central Asiadincluding Mongolia, Chinadas well as Australia and Eastern Africa. The \"Grazing under medium soil constraints\" cluster is similar, except that soil conditions are a more severe constraint. This cluster typically occurs in Central Asia and the United States. The \"Moderate soil and water constraints\" cluster has medium environmental constraints, with land degradation being a higher environmental stressor than the remaining seven stressors. Together with the relatively poor soils conditions, land degradation is also reflected in the limited availability of cropland. In terms of geographic coverage, this cluster is relatively small, with exemplary locations in the Andes, Botswana, Mexico, Central and Western Australia. The cluster with the best environmental conditions is the \"Cropping\" cluster, which has the most abundant water and land resources. The cropping cluster includes the largest amount of cropland, even given the high land degradation that occurs in this cluster. This cluster is one of the smallest clusters and occurs primarily in the United States, India, the Mediterranean region, and the border region between Kazakhstan and Russia.\\nAs Fig. 4 shows, the clusters do not necessarily differ from each other in all dimensions but may overlap in some. For example, there is a group of clusters that all show high levels of land degradation, such as the clusters \"Little water scarcity\", \"Grazing under medium soil constraints\", and \"Cropping\", but differ significantly in pasture and crop area. This points at differences, among others, in the quality and management of natural resources.',\n",
       "  'Linking the patterns of environmental drivers with observed hotspots of negative net-migration': 'Table 2 shows the mean values for population density, density of negative net-migration and standard deviation (SD), and the share of migrants from the total population for each cluster. Clearly, population density and absolute migrant density vary considerably between the clusters. The absolute numbers of negative netmigration are particularly high in the clusters \"Little water scarcity\" and \"Cropping\", which is not surprising given that these clusters have the highest population density. Moreover, these two clustersdand therefore regionsdare easier to access, as they are better connected in terms of transport and infrastructure. These clusters cover wide areas in southern Sahel, the Andes, and Northeast Brazil (\"Little water scarcity\"), as well as India, East China, and Turkey (\"Cropping\"). In turn, the two clusters with the lowest population densities (i.e. the two desert clusters) have the lowest absolute numbers of negative net-migration. While the relationship between population density and absolute migration numbers is rather linear across all clusters the relationship between population density and relative numbers of negative net-migrants (i.e. the proportion of negative net-migrants from the entire population) per cluster is non-linear (see Fig. 5). For example, the cluster \"Cropping\"dthe cluster with both the highest population density and absolute migration numbersdhad the lowest proportion of migrants amongst all of the clusters. In the two sparsely populated desert clusters, high relative negative net-migration was related to various factors. For example, whereas environmental factors contribute primarily to migration in Mauritania, political and economic factors contribute primarily to migration in Somalia. Furthermore, these societiesddesert nomadsdhave typically been characterised by high mobility, given their way of life. Interestingly, the cluster \"Little water scarcity\" had the second highest absolute migration numbers and one of the highest proportions of migrants amongst all of the clusters, and we can conclude that this cluster is more prone to migration than the other clusters.\\nBased on Fig. 2, we selected two hotspots of negative netmigration: Burkina Faso and Northeast Brazil. We have chosen these hotspots since 1) they are characterized by high negative netmigration, 2) published literature is available on environmental constraints and how they contribute to outmigration in these regions, and 3) they represent regions with different political, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds which allows us to hint at the global variety of environment-related migration processes in drylands. Here, we describe for both hotspots the most important environmental constraints and discuss whether dand howdthese constraints trigger out-migration. We will use case studies based on published literature to evaluate the identified clusters.',\n",
       "  'Hotspot 1: Burkina Faso': 'From 1990 to 2000, the population of Burkina Faso increased rapidly from 9.3 million to 12.3 million and is expected to continue increasing (United Nations, 2010). This population explosion resulted in increased land pressure, which in turn triggered an overexploitation of land resources, for example by reducing fallow periods and increasing the number of livestock. The consequences are the subject of debate; whereas Rochette (1990) argues that pressure on land resources caused land degradation, Gray (1999) emphasises the scale-dependency of land degradation and concludes that land degradation in Burkina Faso can only be confirmed on a large scale but not at the field scale. In our cluster results, the cluster \"Little water scarcity\"dthe highest occurring cluster in Burkina Fasodwas characterised by land degradation. As a result of soil degradation, the smallholder and pastoralist systems became more vulnerable to climate variability and other stresses, for example during the droughts in the 1970s. Land pressuredwhich is expressed in our cluster analysis as the availability of cropland and pasture landd is also reflected in the cluster \"Little water scarcity\", which contains relatively little pasture land. Although a range of soil and water conservation measures were employed (Maatman, Sawadogo, Schweigman, & Ouedraogo, 1998;Masse et al., 2011), livelihood conditions did not improve sufficiently to prevent migration. In addition, Burkina Faso has a long history of migration, and the Burkinabe are known to be highly mobile both within and across national borders (Cordell, Gregory, & Pich e, 1996;Howorth & O\\'Keefe, 1999). This migration was encouraged by the French colonial government, and after independence, migration was triggered by the rapid expansion of the economy of Côte d\\'Ivoire and cocoa production (Breusers, 1999). Thus, environmental stressors may trigger migration more strongly in Burkina Faso than in other countries, as migration networks are already in place. In contrast, the political crisis in Côte d\\'Ivoire, which was partly caused by the high rate of immigration into the country, triggered a massive wave of return migrants to Burkina Faso and caused major problems with the reinsertion of these migrants into an already overburdened land use system (Courtin, 2011). According to our cluster results, compared to regions associated with other clusters, Burkina Faso is restricted relatively little by water availability. The cluster \"Little water scarcity\" has lower aridity, fewer droughts, and higher precipitation level relatively to the remaining clusters, and land degradation is the primary constraint. In contrast, Henry, Boyle, and Lambin (2003) studied the environmentemigration relationship at the national level (rather than at the global level) and found that rainfall variability and land degradation were approximately equally strong determinants of inter-provincial migration in Burkina Faso. On a whole, we can conclude that in Burkina Faso, environmental factors such as land degradation, land pressure, and water availability are potential drivers of out-migration. Nevertheless, the strength at which these drivers operate depends on the scale of the analysis.',\n",
       "  'Hotspot 2: Northeast Brazil': 'In Northeast Brazil, smallholders are a major group for whom migration is an important livelihood strategy (Finan & Nelson, 2001;Nelson & Finan, 2009). Because they live in the poorest regions of the country, smallholders in Northeast Brazil are highly constrained with respect to their natural and technological resources (Finan & Nelson, 2001;Sietz et al., 2006). Both agricultural intensification and population growth have increased pressure on the land and triggered land degradation (Lemos, 2001). As a result  of land degradation, large areas of Northeast Brazil experienced less profitable agricultural production and a subsequent decrease in onfarm activities in the late 1990s (Sietz et al., 2006). Migrationdwith regional urban centres and more affluent Southern Brazilian or land reclamation areas in the Amazon region being common migration destinationsdis a commonly used strategy to adapt to deteriorated resources (Krol & Bronstert, 2007;Nelson & Finan, 2009). According to our cluster results, Northeast Brazil is part of the cluster \"Little water scarcity\", which is characterised by land degradation, thereby confirming the findings of the aforementioned local studies. In addition to land degradation, droughts are also an important environmental push factor. In rural Cear a, droughts have historically triggered migration; however, because the government provides food, water, and financial support to drought-affected people, drought-related migration has decreased significantly. Nevertheless, rural-urban migration remains a common livelihood strategy and strategy for coping with droughts (Nelson & Finan, 2009). However, droughts do not occur more frequently in the cluster \"Little water scarcity\" than in other clusters. From this result, we can conclude either that droughts are insufficiently represented in this cluster or that other environmental factors (such as land degradation and land pressure) are more constraining. Reuveny (2007) estimates that 8 million Brazilians have outmigrated from Northeast Brazil since the 1960s. In addition to droughts, land degradation, water scarcity, and deforestation Reuveny identified population pressure, poverty, unequal land distribution, unclear property rights, and government-subsidised settlers as primary push factors. However, ranking the importance of these factors was beyond the scope of this study. In summary, the evidence suggests that income and employment differences play a key role in explaining migration from Northeast Brazil, and these differences are determined largely by environmental change, including land degradation and drought (Barbieri et al., 2010). This illustrates the role of the environment as an indirect driver of migration and demonstrates how tightly environmental and economic factors can be intertwined, thus making it nearly impossible to attribute migration to one or both factors.',\n",
       "  'Discussion': '',\n",
       "  'Environmental versus non-environmental drivers of migration': 'Adverse environmental conditions can be either partially or completely offset by strong socio-economic and governance conditions, which inevitably raises the question of the importance of environmental factors alone when explaining the humanenvironment system. For example, Henry et al. (2003) show that migration in Burkina Faso can empirically be better explained using a combination of environmental and socio-economic factors rather than environmental factors alone. With respect to our clusters, the effect of high aridity as for example identified for the cluster \"Grazing under water constraints\" may be limited by the use of efficient irrigation facilities. However, in addition to the requirement for available water resources, farmers must also possess the knowledge and skills needed for the efficient use of irrigation water, and they must have the necessary funds to invest in an appropriate irrigation infrastructure. Another factor that can offset the effects of adverse environmental conditions on migration is the presence of alternative employment opportunities and income, for example from oil industries in North Africa and the Middle East, which may explain the relative paucity of out-migration in these regions. With respect to economic and governance conditions, considerable differences exist between regions and countries, which may improve adverse environmental conditions in some regions whilst making them worse in others. Although this integration of environmental, political, and socio-economic factors is essential for realistic future assessments of potential migration in drylands, such an assessment was beyond the scope of our study, as our goal was to provide a better representation of the environmental drivers of migration. Moreover, reliable and spatially explicit data regarding the socio-economic drivers of migration are rare, thereby hampering our ability to obtain a complete picture.',\n",
       "  'Policy implications': 'The results presented in this paper suggest cluster-specific policies to remedy observed migration patterns. Here, we illustrate possible entry points for strategic interventions for a few exemplary clusters. In the four most water limited clusters, namely the two desert clusters, the \"Grazing under water constraints\" cluster, and the \"Moderate soil and water constraints\" cluster major interventions would be required to better deal with the pronounced water scarcity including measures to store and use existing water resources more efficiently and decrease water withdrawal. In many developing countries where high aridity, high drought frequency and low precipitation combines with limited institutional capacities in the water sector (ECA, 2000), low cost water-saving strategies for livestock keeping and cropping should be fostered rather than increasing water availability per se. Moreover, organising water rights can provide farmers and herders with added certainty regarding water access, and this may help reduce vulnerability due to water stress. In addition, the \"Grazing under water constraints\" cluster would additionally benefit from readjustments of grazing intensities. This may necessitate strategies for developing alternative land-independent livelihoods. In the \"Little water scarcity\" clusterd which has shown to be particularly prone to out-migrationdinterventions would particularly target land rehabilitation and improvement in land access. For example, in the rural areas of Northeast Brazil (falling into this cluster), where the majority of farmers face difficulties to make a living due to severe land degradation and poverty, interventions would focus on improving soil quality and vegetation cover based on conservation measures (Sietz, 2014). Better access to fertile land, which is largely concentrated in the hands of large-holder farmers, would further contribute to mediate the causes for out-migration due to expected positive effects on agricultural production. Given the global coverage of our study, these policy implications are necessarily broad implying the need for regional adjustments to adequately reflect specific underlying processes, social groups and implementation approaches (Birkmann, 2007). In addition, policies for better managing migration need to be integrated into the wider development strategies to be successful. This integration does not only require appropriate knowledge and resources, but furthermore strongly relies on supporting institutions, which are however frequently lacking in the climate adaptation domain (Biesbroek, Klostermann, Termeer, & Kabat, 2013). Therefore, refined policies for migration management need to be operationalised while considering the specific institutional context in the regions targeted.',\n",
       "  'Summary and conclusions': \"Migration is a widely recognised consequence of environmental change and, environment-induced migration has been given priority on international policy agendas. For example, migration has been formally introduced into the regime of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with the agreement on the Cancun Adaptation Framework at the 2010 UNFCCC COP16 meeting, which invited all interested parties to partake in 'measures to enhance understanding, co-ordination and co-operation with regard to climate-change induced displacement, migration and planned relocation, where appropriate' (UNFCCC, 2010). However, despite its clear relevance, research regarding the potential for human systemsdincluding migrationdto adapt to environmental change is less advanced than research regarding biophysical systems, ecological impacts, and the mitigation of environmental change (Wilbanks et al., 2007). Our study represents an empirical contribution to the description of environmental drivers of migration at the macro-scale. Our goal was to explore potential environmental drivers of human migration using a spatially explicit analysis and link those drivers to observed hotspots of out-migration. To achieve this goal, we performed a cluster analysis. Using the applied methodology, we identified the most severe environmental constraints in each cluster (and therefore, in each region). We show that the clustersdand the most severe environmental constraints and potential migration incentivesdcan vary widely across space. We therefore conclude that in addition to regional strategies, location-specific measures are needed to adequately address environmentally motivated migration. On the other hand, the results do not support ranking the regions based on their environmental characteristics along a gradient from low migration incentives to high migration incentives. Therefore, a spatially explicit ranking of regions based on the impact of their environmental drivers of migration is currently out of reach.\\nWe can draw several conclusions from our hotspot analysis. First, environmental factors play a major role in migration processes in Burkina Faso and Northeast Brazil. In these two regions, adverse environmental conditions likely cause a decline in the livelihood of the rural population, who usually respond with outmigration. Second, alternative income opportunities in other rural areas (Burkina Faso) or urban areas (Burkina Faso and Brazil) act as strong pull factors in combination with environmental degradation acting as a push factor. This combination of pull and push factors demonstrates the strong interdependence between environmental and economic factors, and it underscores the challenge in identifying the root cause of migration. Third, the scale of analysis likely influences the findings. The results of the global scale cluster analysis suggest that land degradation is the most severe environmental constraint for both hotspots. However, national-level analyses for Burkina Faso revealed that rainfall variability and soil degradation are approximately equally strong determinants of intra-provincial migration. With respect to Brazil, we conclude that similar differences likely exist between outcomes from the global and national scales. These findings suggest that one must select the scale of the analysis carefully based on the context of the study and the available data.\\nThe approach presented here is particularly valuable for describing environmental factors that influence migration in drylands using a spatially explicit method. However, identifying the trigger points for out-migration and quantifying actual stocks or flows of environmentally motivated migrants will require a more in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms in which socio-economic and political factors interact with environmental drivers of human migration. Consequently, the clusters identified here can be used to discuss possible migration incentivesdespecially incentives related to environmental pressuresdrather than to explain the migration dynamics themselves.\"},\n",
       " 24: {'abstract': \"In recent years, the issue of the nexus of climate change and human migration has attracted a growing amount of interest among scholars and policy makers. Using individual-level data from the Tanzania National Panel Survey conducted in 2008-2009, we examine the roles played by droughts or floods, crop diseases, and severe water shortages in inter-district migration in Tanzania. Findings reveal that droughts or floods and crop diseases are associated with an overall decrease in the likelihood of inter-district mobility, providing support for the ''environmental scarcity'' hypothesis. Yet migration becomes a likely response to droughts and floods among individuals with no education suggesting mobility is a key livelihood strategy among those most disadvantaged. Future examination of domestic migration-environment processes at the individual-level is critical for informed policy and programs.\",\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"In recent years, climate change has become a major concern in the international context, and addressing climate challenges has become a priority for a wide range of actors worldwide. Mobility might be expected to increase following extreme events, such as storms, floods, and droughts; as well as in response to gradual changes in temperatures, precipitation, and sea levels. Yet predicting the effects of climate change on population movement remains a challenging task.\\nThe literature on the link between environmental factors and migration offers two main perspectives on the question of how individuals and households will respond to these changes. The first predicts movement as adaptation to environmental change. Migration can indeed be seen as a coping mechanism or as a last-resort solution (McLeman and Smit 2006;Barnett and Webber 2010;Tacoli 2009), a proactive or reactive strategy (IOM 2008). 1 For South America, Leighton noted that ''the periodic drought and desertification plaguing northeast Brazil contributed to factors causing 3.4 million people to emigrate between 1960 and 1980'' (Leighton 2006: 47). According to Kniveton et al. (2008), drought led to an increase in the number of individuals who engaged in short-term rural-rural migration. In addition, Afifi and Warner (2008) examined the impact of 13 different environmental factors across 172 countries of the world and found all had a significantly positive impact on migration flows.\\nThe second perspective envisages a negative link between environmental factors and migration-the ''environmental scarcity'' hypothesis. For example, Findley (1994) investigated the consequences on migration of a series of droughts in Mali, 1983Mali, -1985. . The results revealed a reduction in international migration during these drought years. More recently, Henry et al. (2003) studied the determinants of interprovincial migration flows in Burkina Faso, and found that droughts, rainfall variability, and severe soil degradation contributed only marginally to migration. In addition, the study of Paul (2005) provided empirical evidence that there was no out-migration from the villages affected by the tornado in the north-central Bangladesh on April 14, 2004.\\nHowever, environmentally induced migration is a complex phenomenon, as environmental change is usually identified as being only one of the many drivers of migration (Castles 2002). The decision to migrate is usually influenced not only by environmental factors, but also by cultural, economic, political, and social conditions. In each specific context, these interactions can increase or decrease migration (Black et al. 2011a;Piguet et al. 2011;Renaud et al. 2011). Moreover, the diversity in the types and forms of mobility, as well as the lack of mobility in regions affected by adverse environmental conditions, contribute to the complexity of this relationship (Tacoli 2011;Laczko and Aghazarm 2009).\\nThis paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on the role of environmental factors in internal mobility in the African context (Van der Land and Hummel 2013; Msigwa and Mbongo 2013;Sow et al. 2014). Our goal in this paper is to investigate the effect of drought or floods, crop diseases, and severe water shortages on inter-district migration in the United Republic of Tanzania, while controlling for several socio-demographic variables. The 2008-2009 Tanzania National Panel Survey (TZNPS) is a unique dataset, which allows us to examine the link between the environment and migration at the individual level, and to disentangle the interaction between this link and the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, particularly educational levels given past evidence of the important association between migration and education in this setting (Striessnig et al. 2013). Tanzania provides an excellent case study for several reasons. First, the link between environment and migration has only very recently begun to be explored in this country, so this research offers an important baseline (see, for example, the analysis conducted by Liwenga et al., 2012). Second, Tanzania is highly vulnerable to droughts and floods (Raleigh et al. 2008), and a number of studies have found that climate change is already having a significant impact on the natural resources of the country (Agrawala et al. 2003;Majule 2008a, b;Liwenga et al. 2012). Third, in addition to having to cope with a large number of refugees arriving from neighboring countries (NBS 2006), Tanzania has recently experienced high levels of internal movements toward commercial and industrial areas (e.g., Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar town), or toward regions with new economic opportunities related to the growth of non-agricultural activities, such as mining or tourism (e.g., Arusha and Kagera regions).\",\n",
       "  'Data, measures, and selected sample': \"We use data from the TZNPS, carried out by the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) from October 2008 to October 2009. The TZNPS is part of an ongoing project on the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), which is in turn part of the LSMS2 in the World Bank's Development Economic Research Group. The survey, scheduled to be repeated every 2 years, provides regular information on key development indicators useful for monitoring poverty dynamics in the country. Three different questionnaires were administered in the first baseline round used in our study: a multi-topic household questionnaire, a community questionnaire, and a questionnaire focused on agriculture.\\nOverall, 3,265 households with a total of 16,709 individuals were interviewed. This sample spanned all of the Tanzanian regions and districts (for details on the sampling strategy, see the document ''Sample Design for the National Panel Survey''-April 2009).\\nThe survey was not specifically designed to study migration movements and adverse environmental conditions. Thus, some standard assumptions were used to identify migrants as well as those potentially affected by adverse environmental conditions. A migrant was defined as a person aged 15 or older who had moved from one to another district in the 5 years prior to the interview. Migrants who moved into or out of the country were excluded from the analysis, given our focus on internal migration. The 5-year time frame was introduced to allow measurement of migration with the same temporal resolution available for environmental shocks, which had been recorded retrospectively for a period of up to 5 years before the interview. The age of 15 was chosen as a benchmark because it is reasonable to assume that people in Tanzania could start to live independently of their family of origin at around this age. This age has often been used in previous studies on similar topics (Henry et al. 2003(Henry et al. , 2004;;Gray and Mueller 2011).\\nOrigin and destination districts were identified using the following two questions: ''For how many years have you lived in this community?'' and ''From which district did you move?'' Respondents living in the community for \\\\5 years were considered migrants. The year of migration was computed by contrasting the interview year with the year in which the person began living in the district of interview. The destination and origin districts were derived from the first and second questions, respectively.\\nA specific section of the household questionnaire was devoted to the measurement of different shocks, environmental or otherwise, experienced in the 5 years prior to the interview. 3 Respondents were asked: ''Over the past 5 years, was your household severely affected negatively by any of the following events?'' Eighteen different types of shocks are listed in the response options, and we focused on those most directly related to environmental events, such as drought and floods, crop diseases or crop pests, and severe water shortages. Respondents were also asked to rank the three most relevant shocks according to their level of severity and, as such, if multiple shocks were reported, we included that reported as most severe.\\nSince information on the years in which the three most severe shocks occurred was available, we were could time inter-district migration vis-a-vis the shock. Given our analytical focus on migration as a response to environmental stress, individuals who migrated before the environmental shocks were excluded from the analysis.\\nAfter this selection process, the analytical sample included 2,883 individuals aged 15 or above, 6 % of whom migrated from one Tanzanian district to another in the 5-year period preceding the survey, i.e., 2004-2008. Within the group of migrants, 42 % reported having experienced any of the three selected environmental shocks prior to their inter-district move. In most of these cases (82 %), the shock had occurred one or 2 years before the inter-district migration, and in 51 % the shock had occurred in the year immediately before the move. Consistent with some recent research that has demonstrated a lag time in migratory response to environmental shocks (Hunter et al. 2013), we considered internal migrations that occurred up to 5 years after the environmental shock. We are aware that a smaller temporal frame would provide a greater degree of certainty about the link between these two events.\",\n",
       "  'Model and results': '',\n",
       "  'Model specification': \"Logistic regression models were used to estimate the impact of environmental shocks on inter-district migration. The response is a dichotomous variable (1 = migration), as is each environmental shock (1 = shock). Several sociodemographic variables are included: gender, age, level of education, marital status, and the number of children. Gender is a dummy variable (1 = female), and age is represented through a three-categorical variable: 15-29, 30-59 and 60 years and above. Three educational level categories are included: no education, primary education, and a high level of education (secondary or higher). The three educational categories reflect the structure of the Tanzania's educational system, as reported in Table 1.\\nMarital status is coded as a dummy variable (1 = spouse living in household) and four categories are created for number of children living in the household: zero, one, two or three, and four or more. The distributions of all variables are reported in Table 2. Most respondents were male, aged 30-59, with primary education and no children. On environmental shocks, 15 % reported having experienced droughts or floods, 13 % were affected by crop diseases or crop pests, and 22 % had experienced severe water shortages. In addition, the estimates of the univariate logistic regression models,4 for each of the selected variables included in the final models, show that all the socio-demographic variables are statistically significant at 95 % level of confidence in the prediction of internal migration, with the exception of gender. Moreover, the three environmental variables were also found to be statistically significant, but their effects on migration differed: experience of ''drought or floods'' and ''crop disease or crop pests'' shocks was negatively associated with internal migration, and thus appear to have acted as deterrents to inter-district mobility, whereas the ''severe water shortage'' shock demonstrated a positive association with internal migration. Within the multivariate models, we used a robust variance estimator for clustered data which releases corrected standard errors of the coefficients5 by taking into account the intra-district correlation; i.e., the fact that people living in the same district are more similar than people living in different districts.\",\n",
       "  'Results': \"The results of the multivariate logistic regression models are reported in Table 3. Model I presents the estimates of the additive model, while Model II reports the estimates of the interaction model. In the end, we retained in the final model only the interaction terms which reached statistical significance (at 95 % level of confidence). As is well-known, the odds ratios can be interpreted as the multiplicative effects of a one-unit increase in the predictor on the odds of the outcome (i.e., migration) relative to the reference outcome (i.e., no migration). In agreement with the results of the univariate models, the results of Model I suggest the environmental shocks of droughts/floods or of crop diseases/pests acted as deterrents to inter-district migration. Specifically, net of the model's control variables, respondents who experienced drought or floods were 49 % less likely to migrate, and those who experienced crop disease or crop pests were 74 % less likely to migrate, as contrasted to respondents not experiencing such shocks (Model I). By contrast, the experience of a severe water shortage did not significantly influence inter-district migration.\\nIn Model II, the estimates for the environmental shocks' effects on migration suggest migration may be a coping strategy particularly of importance to those lacking education. Indeed, even if the environmental shocks of droughts/floods acted as deterrent to inter-district migration net of the model's control variables, the interaction between the level of education and this environmental shock reveals a higher propensity to move (about four times as high) for individuals with no education contrasted with individuals with primary education. In addition, although highly educated respondents are more likely to migrate in general, their probability of migration was not additionally shaped by environmental strain.\\nIn agreement with the results of Model I, the results of Model II show the same effects for the environmental shocks: droughts/floods and crop diseases/pests acted as deterrents to inter-district migration, while the experience of a severe water shortage did not significantly influence mobility.\\nOn controls, both for Models I and II, the demographic variables are all statistically significant, with the exception of gender. Moreover, their effect in terms of both magnitude and sign is almost identical in the two models, with (Model II) and without interaction terms (Model I). Age decreases the propensity to move, which peaks at the ages 15-29 and then declines; being married and having children in the household were negatively associated with the propensity to move. We also found that the probability of migration was about twice as high among respondents with high levels of education as contrasted with those with primary education (Models I and II). By contrast, respondents with no education tended to stay in their district (this effect was not statistically significant in Model I).\",\n",
       "  'Concluding remarks': \"The number of studies examining the link between climate change and human migration has grown significantly in recent years. But the results have not yet yielded generalisable conclusions. The research presented here represents one of the first attempts to study the link between internal migration and environmental change in the United Republic of Tanzania using household-level survey data.\\nConventional narratives posit that displacements will inevitably occur under climate change (e.g., Myers 2002;Warner et al. 2009). To the contrary, this research provides empirical evidence that adverse environmental conditions actually decrease internal mobility in Tanzania: Being exposed to droughts or floods and to crop diseases or crop pests had a negative and statistically significant effect on the likelihood of inter-district migration. This result remained even after we controlled for a set of socio-demographic variables.\\nIn line with research by Black et al. (2011b), our results reveal that mobility is selective. Barriers to mobility include lack of social, economic, and human resources. Thus, the effects of environmental change on migration may vary across social groups. Indeed, our findings suggest the link between migration and adverse environmental conditions differs by educational level of the potential migrant. Importantly, least-educated respondents were more likely to respond to environmental shocks through migration, suggesting an important coping strategy among those most disadvantaged. This finding is only partially consistent with Black et al. (2011b), who described the poorest and least mobile people as a ''trapped population.'' They found that impoverished people face a double set of risks: They are unable to move away from environmental threats, and their lack of capital makes them especially vulnerable to environmental changes.\\nA possible explanation for the negative association between migration and environmental shocks lies in government policies to improve resilience. For example, the National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction was designed to stimulate economic growth in the affected regions and to improve the quality of life and the social well being of the affected people. Recently, other strategies like rainfall-based insurance have been proposed (e.g., Sarris et al. 2006).\\nIn line with a number of recent studies on environmentally induced population mobility (Halliday 2006;Gray 2009;Massey et al. 2010;Black et al. 2011a), our empirical analysis underscores two important insights: that the relationship between climate change and migration is not always unidirectional, and that adverse environmental conditions might discourage rather than encourage internal migration. An important extension of the current analysis would supplement the included subjective measures of environmental shocks with analogous measures derived from the official statistics. Another extension will involve the second wave of the TZNPS, allowing a longitudinal perspective. This approach will facilitate understanding of whether the migration-environment association appears to reflect a proactive or a reactive strategy.\\nIn all, this research contributes to support the ''environmental scarcity'' hypothesis illustrating that droughts or floods and crop diseases are associated with an overall decrease in the likelihood of internal migration in Tanzania. The complexity revealed also challenges the idea of a simple, unidirectional link between environmental factors and migration.\"},\n",
       " 25: {'abstract': \"Despite the theoretical and methodological critique of deterministic and linear explanations of migration under changing climatic conditions, many empirical case studies in this fi eld remain deeply entrenched in static push-pull frameworks and tend to reproduce simplistic causal relationships. Drawing on results from an interdisciplinary research project in Mali and Senegal, the chapter presents a methodological approach that emanates from past analytical shortcomings. By adopting a local perspective on migration, we consider cultural norms, the migration history and people's interpretations of weather and environmental changes. Moreover, we argue for a multilevel, multi-method research that seeks to separate the two research topics of migration and climate/environment; for example, by avoiding explicit questions about possible linkages. Contrasting results from ethnographic fi eldwork concerning migration, climate and environment with 'hard' data on climate and vegetation allows us to become more susceptible for the social construction of alleged 'facts' such as droughts and land degradation as drivers for migration. We place a focus upon local meanings of weather and environment by considering how they are being assessed by the people, within a context of not only climatic but rather multiple changes.This chapter addresses the potential impacts of climate change on population movement by adopting a local perspective. Two case studies from rural Mali and Senegal serve to reveal the ambiguous relationship between climate change, environmental changes and migration. The relevance of the topic seems to be apparent in relation to the West African Sahel, given that the region's population is one of the most mobile in the world (Ammassari and Black 2001 ), while mean annual temperatures\",\n",
       "  '': 'have risen since the 1960s and increased precipitation variability is predicted for the future (Boko et al. 2007 ). Moreover, the severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s involved massive changes in vegetation patterns, thus rendering the African Sahel a hotspot of environmental degradation and desertifi cation (Kandji et al. 2006 ). Assumptions of this kind, embedded in the highly politicised discourse on climate change, perpetuate the belief that there is a growing impact of climate factors on population movements (Piguet et al. 2011 ), especially in developing countries, leading to estimates of the future magnitude of climate-related population displacements. However, most scholars oppose such estimated numbers and refer to people being at risk of becoming displaced rather than depicting possible migration fl ows (see p. 8 in Black 2001 ). The IPCC \\'s 4th assessment report emphasises the importance of migration as one of the key options for adaptation to climate stress, as well as underlining that a variety of other factors may contribute to the decision to migrate (Boko et al. 2007 ). This complexity of migration points to fundamental shortcomings in much of the scientifi c and public discourse on the environment-migration nexus. This chapter contributes to the present volume\\'s concern with context regarding the explanatory power of climate for changes within social systems. Accordingly, it seeks to re-contextualise assumed \\'natural\\' drivers of migration processes in order to balance simplifi ed assumptions of the relationship between climate, environment and migration.\\nIn order to identify population movements that are affected by climate change, it is necessary to understand the linkages between environmental changes and migration, considering multiple levels of analysis and different temporal and spatial scales (Kniveton et al. 2008 ). Moreover, further challenges that arise in understanding the migration-environment nexus include the lack of a clear defi nition and use of controversially discussed terms such as \\'environmental refugees\\'1 or \\'climate refugees,\\' the general scarcity of migration data, especially in developing countries (particularly longitudinal data), the lack of detailed knowledge about the impacts of climate change on environmental conditions (e.g. the evolution of local vegetation trends), and the failure to consider adaptive practices other than migration (cf. Adamo 2008 ;Bates 2002 ;Black 2001 ;Castles 2002 ;Renaud et al. 2007 ).\\nThe simplifi ed portrayal of environmental changes as root causes of migration has been contested by many scholars, both theoretically and empirically (de Haan et al. 2002 ;Findley 1994 ;Van der Geest et al. 2010 ;Henry et al. 2003 ;Piguet 2008 ;Doevenspeck 2011 ). Argumentation within the static push-pull framework has been further criticised for being too deterministic, since it suggests that migrants are being \\'pushed\\' out of degraded areas, rather than allowing for the various other dimensions of human migration (Jónsson 2010 ). With the exception of extreme events such as fl ight after natural disasters, \"[it] thus seems analytically impossible to identify a migration stream as principally environmentally-induced\" (see p. 51 in Doevenspeck 2011 ). Therefore, further research faces the challenge of balancing the multitude of factors shaping migratory patterns in the context of environmental change, in order to grasp the internal logics of migration dynamics (cf. p. 420 in Castles 2011 ). Similarly, changes of climatic conditions are unlikely to directly cause people to move, yet may produce environmental effects and exacerbate current vulnerabilities in a way that may render migration one possible strategy of adaptation.\\nAny attempt within the vast spectrum of approaches to understand the linkages between climate, environmental changes and migration also faces severe methodological challenges (cf. Piguet 2010 ). One major and general diffi culty is to evaluate an isolated correlation between climate or environmental parameters and migration variables, considering the complexity of other contextual effects on migration processes. Ethnography applying thick description through observation, in-depth and biographical interviews with individual migrants can avoid some of the diffi culties of other methods, given that it is a place-sensitive approach and provides an insight into social constructions of alleged \\'facts,\\' such as environmental degradation and droughts, people\\'s perceptions and experiences (see Meze-Hausken 2000 ;McLeman and Smit 2006 ;Mortreux and Barnett 2009 ). However, there are three essential shortcomings related to conceptual fl aws in interview techniques of ethnographic and quantitative (large-scale sample surveys) approaches. First, it must be recognised that research results are shaped by the way in which questions are formulated. Interviewees often undergo an intensive \\'problem-scanning\\' with respect to their migration motives, economic situation and environmental changes. Second, it is diffi cult to avoid general narratives on climate, the environment and migration issues. Third and most fundamentally, a causal linkage between environmental changes and migration is often taken for granted in research designs and refl ected in questions that directly ask for these linkages, thus leading to a perpetuation and reifi cation of this narrative. This is problematic, since it is the researcher rather than the respondent who hints at causal connections. Mertz et al. ( 2009 ) suggest how \\'hinting at problems\\' and causal linkages can bias research results, having conducted a study in rural Senegal to analyse people\\'s perception of climate change and their coping and adaptation strategies by applying household questionnaires and different types of interviews. To avoid biases, they only posed climate-related questions towards the end of the interviews. Indeed, none of the respondents identifi ed climate factors among the fi ve main positive or challenging aspects of their village life (not even within the category of agriculture). \"Only when asked directly about climate issues did the group interviews largely corroborate the impacts identifi ed in the household interviews, and they reiterated that rainfall variability during the rainy season is of major importance\" (see p. 810 in Mertz et al. 2009 ). This example demonstrates that suggestive interviewing considerably infl uences responses and should thus be avoided when seeking to grasp the relevance of climatic conditions and the environment for rural households.\\nGiven the conceptual shortcomings, this chapter will provide evidence of the complexity of the environment-migration nexus by discussing results from a research project on migration and local assessments of climatic and environmental changes in Mali and Senegal. As the Sahelian drylands are frequently presented as hotspots of climate change impacts (Hulme 2001 ) and the population is seen as very likely to become displaced by environmental degradation (IOM2 2009 ), two study areas in Senegal and Mali have been selected in order to understand how these assumptions translate at the local level. Macro data on climate is contrasted with fi ndings on local people\\'s assessments of changes in climate conditions and the environment (see also West et al. 2008 ) and contextualised with the identifi ed patterns, dynamics, motives and people\\'s notion of migration. Through this process, we are not evaluating the effects of climate trends in the study areas as outcomes of global climate change; rather, we argue in favour of assessing the relevance of various trends in climate variability and the importance of its different cultural, social and political dimensions by focusing on local people\\'s representation, perception and interpretation of climate and environmental changes. Considering the conceptual and methodical diffi culties of carving out the relevance of climate and environmental factors in migration decisions, this chapter puts forward a methodological approach that attempts to avoid suggestive causality between climate, environment and migration in the research design.\\nFollowing a presentation of the study regions and the methodological approach, we offer an analysis of current climate and vegetation trends and how people assess them locally. The second empirical part provides a historically informed analysis of the contemporary migration landscape, including patterns, motives and destinations, before the chapter concludes with some conceptual and methodological refl ections on this approach to grasping the local dimensions of environment, climate and migration.',\n",
       "  'Study Regions': \"Research is conducted in the two study areas of Linguère, Senegal, and Bandiagara, Mali (see Fig. 5.1 ). Both regions belong to the semi-arid Sahel-Sudan region, yet differ in their socio-economic context as well as their cultural and historical migration background. While the Linguère area is part of a traditionally important pastoral zone, the drylands of Bandiagara are mainly farmland, although crop production is important in both study regions. In Linguère, many of the pastoralist families nowadays are sedentary and practise both the cultivation of land and livestock breeding. However, our study focuses on general patterns of people's mobility rather than the specifi c movements of herders with their cattle. The selection of the study regions was based on the criteria of high population mobility, peculiarity of environmental change and accessibility of the regions.\\nThe area around Linguère is situated in the northern part of Senegal in the region of Louga, department of Linguère (also known as the Ferlo ) (Fig. 5.1 ). Around 80 % of the population lives in rural areas, with the Fulani and Wolof being the largest ethnic-linguistic groups (ANSD 3 2007 ). This agro-sylvo-pastoral area is sparsely populated (14 inhabitants per km 2 [inh./km 2 ]), characterised by an average annual rainfall of 380 mm and dominated by open shrub and tree savanna and grasslands (Tappan et al. 2004 ). Economic activities concentrate on livestock breeding and crop production (mainly millet and groundnut). Relying on the most recent migration data available (ANSD 2008 ), Louga shows an overall migration defi cit (ANSD 2007 ) with 18 % of Senegal's international migrants originating from this region in 2002, making it the third most important region in terms of migrant origins, after Dakar and Thiès (see p.  tree savanna. Rainfed agriculture and to a certain extent vegetable gardening are the main economic activities (MEA 6 2009 ). Dogon and to a much lesser extent Fulani are the predominant ethno-linguistic groups. In the early-1990s, the region's migration defi cit for both international and internal movements was among the highest in the country (Bocquier and Diarra 1999 ). Data from a 2005 survey reveal that 61 % of the interviewed households in the Mopti region mentioned one or more migrating members (WFP7 2006 ), thus indicating a long tradition of labour migration (Sieveking and Fauser 2009 ). Besides migration to Bamako (31 %) and other African countries (28 %), rural areas and villages (23 %) are also important destinations for migrants from the Mopti region (WFP 2006 ;Merabet and Gendreau 2007 ).\",\n",
       "  'Methodological Approach': 'Given the fl aws of the different approaches described above, we developed a multimethod and multi-level research design without asking respondents explicit questions about the linkages between environment, climate and migration, let alone asking directly whether climatic and environmental changes cause migration. As already pointed out, such direct questions by researchers tend to trigger answers that refer to master narratives of environmental migration and provide the respondents the opportunity to avoid elaborating on the subtle and complex social and political undercurrents that relate to migration. Moreover, we attempted to separate research on climate and vegetation trends from the migration issues by conducting the respective fi eldwork at different times. During the conversations, we tried to avoid making direct causal links between environmental and climatic factors and migration motives, allowing only the people themselves to establish such potential links.\\nWhile the identifi cation of the study areas essentially followed the idea of ecological inference (high emigration rates and noticeable trends in vegetation cover of a certain area), ethnography helped to identify migration dynamics and motives, as well as grasping assessments of climatic and environmental changes at the local level. Our fi eldwork could be best described as a multi-sited ethnography (see p. 106 in Marcus 1995 ) following migration networks to multiple places in the area of origin and the target regions of migration, which of course have to be understood as potential places of departure for new migration. This approach is motivated by the aim to avoid the sedentary bias inherent in migration research in Africa (see also Verne and Doevenspeck 2012 ). We conceptualise movement \"as constitutive for economic, social and political relations\" (see p. 43 in Urry 2007 ) and mobility as an integral part of human life and not as a problem per se , regardless of the place where this life is lived (see also Sheller and Urry 2006 ;Büscher and Urry 2009 ).\\nWe conducted fi eldwork during 9 months in 2011 and 2012 and used semi-structured and narrative interviews to understand the village\\'s history, directions and amplitudes of and motives for migration, as well as local meanings of these movements. Additionally, we collected biographies of migrants and identifi ed migration networks. On this basis, contacts with migrating family members at various places were established by telephone or via the internet, leading to interviews in Bamako and Dakar, as well as France and Spain. Working with migrants from the study area at their current residence offered valuable insights into migration networks, given that speaking to migrants outside the social structure of their home village seems to produce less biased and more explicit statements regarding their migration decisions. We used also interviews for the study of the assessment of changes in climate and environmental conditions, addressing both the state of and perceived changes of temperature, rainfall and wind, soil fertility, woody cover, biodiversity, capacities of pasture and crop yields (see Mertz et al. 2010 ;Roncoli 2006 ). We conducted the respective interviews with the same people who had already provided insights into migration, or, in case we were unable to encounter them again, referred to members of the same household or family from the same village. Village elders provided valuable information regarding predrought conditions and long-term changes in natural resource and farm-management. Additionally, we conducted transect walks and site visits with individual villagers in the surroundings of settlements. Attention was paid to people\\'s interpretations and explanations of already mentioned and visible changes in vegetation cover, the availability and exploitation of woody resources, soil fertility, crop yields and degradation phenomena. Accordingly, we took these impressions and information into account in later interviews in the respective villages. With the help of a village questionnaire, elders identifi ed trends in the tree species composition of the past 50 years (see for example Gonzalez 2001 ).',\n",
       "  'Changes in Climate and Environment: Local': 'Representations of \"Facts\"\\nWhile the Sahelian region has always been characterised by high climate variability, there is much uncertainty in climate trends and forecasts produced by the different climate models on smaller spatial levels for the West African Sahel (Boko et al. 2007 ;Kandji et al. 2006 ;Hulme 2001 ). When looking at environmental changes in terms of vegetation trends, it may be considered that not only climate (rainfall in particular) but also human factors contribute to long-term changes in the natural environment (Herrmann et al. 2005 ) Following Hulme ( 2008 ), climate can only be understood and must be re-examined as a manifestation of both nature and culture, which implies that its physical dimensions are allowed to be interpreted by their cultural meanings […] [and] that discourses about global climate change have to be re-invented as discourses about local weather and about the relationships between weather and local physical objects and cultural practices (ibid. p. 6).',\n",
       "  'Temperature': \"According to data collected from meteorological stations, an increase in the mean annual temperature can be observed for the western Sahel9 since the 1960s (see Fig. 5.2 ). Boko et al. ( 2007 ) state that there is a rising number of warm spells and a decrease in extremely cold days for the period 1961-2000 in West Africa. Peaks in high mean annual temperatures in the past two decades have been registered for 1998 and 2005. Beyond rainfall, rising average temperatures essentially account for reduced soil moisture and tree cover changes (Gonzalez et al. 2012 ). By determining physiological processes, changes and extremes of temperature may negatively affect crop and livestock production (Stabinsky 2011 ).\\nVillagers in both study areas expressed diverse opinions on temperature trends, providing a variety of interpretations. In contrast to the fi ndings from fi ve West African countries of Maddison ( 2007 ), stating that signifi cant numbers of farmers perceived increasing temperatures, most of the elders in our study areas agreed that it used to be hotter in the past. 10 A couple of interviewees in Senegal independently recalled a phenomenon in the 1960s when birds, paralysed by the heat and unable to fl y, came towards their houses and even into their rooms in search of cooling. Today, some said that suffering from the cold is worse than before, while others claimed that the 'coldness improved' and that it is getting warmer. Only a few people could not identify a general trend in temperature change, suggesting instead that hotter and colder years or periods have always alternated.11 People's assessment of temperature change is clearly infl uenced by their personal experience of seasonal heat waves or cold waves; moreover, even the availability of warm clothing and a blanket can have an impact on a person's views. In general, interpretations of temperature variations were directly or indirectly related to rainfall: the more it rained in the past rainy season, the less intense the heat, people explained. Leaf growth, cloudiness, wind direction and the existence of seasonal water bodies were said to affect the intensity of the heat during the dry season. It also seems that the perceived severity of high temperatures in the past has been reduced by the increased availability of water sources such as boreholes, wells, artifi cial waterholes and dams, compared to the period before the 1970s drought.\\nInterestingly, few of the interviewees perceived the rise in temperatures that has actually been recorded for the region, with most of them reporting decreasing temperatures. Given that abundant rainfall was said to reduce the heat, one potential explanation could be that the increasing amounts of precipitation in recent years (see next section) have signifi cantly infl uenced this perception. Similarly, Roncoli et al. ( 2003 ) report on the infl uence of the intensity and duration of rainfall on farmers' perceptions of dry season temperatures in Burkina Faso. Accordingly, narrations of rising temperatures evidently coincide with perceived decreasing precipitation (cf. Maddison 2007 ).\",\n",
       "  'Precipitation': 'The Linguère region is clearly drier than Bandiagara, as refl ected by a difference in annual rainfall of up to 200 mm (Fig. 5.3 ). While both study regions experienced several severe droughts during the twentieth century, the 1970s and 1980s droughts coincided with a long-lasting drop in the annual precipitation level. In Linguère, for example, this rainfall decline was almost 30 %. While rising precipitation has been recorded for the past two decades in Bandiagara, almost reaching pre-drought levels, Linguère\\'s rainfall has shown a slight increase since 1998. In 2009 and 2010, Bandiagara and Linguère had very abundant rains that locally even reached record values.12 Nevertheless, the apparent gain in mean values goes in hand with the increased variability and unpredictability of rainfall (cf. MEA 2009 ). In 2011, annual precipitation in both study areas did not exceed average amounts. 13The interviewed village elders confi rmed that rainfall today is lower compared to the period prior to the drought in the 1970s. Generally, people seem to have a good memory of the severe droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. However, it must be noted that there are differences between villages within the same study area, and respondents did not feel equally affected. In both study regions, the informants indicated an upward trend in precipitation in the past 5 years, describing the rainfalls of 2009 and 2010 as the most abundant for a long time. Accordingly, rainfall in 2011 was clearly evaluated as being low. However, assessments of the harvests during the past years do not reveal a uniform picture. In both Linguère and Bandiagara, some villages apparently benefi tted from good and very good harvests in 2009 and 2010, with people reporting increased numbers of young people reengaged in agriculture. In other places, most people stressed that the distribution of rainfall was of much greater importance14 than its total annual amount. Missing breaks between rainfalls, fl oods after heavy rains, persisting moisture on the fi elds and delayed, altogether lacking or too little rainfall during certain periods of plant growth mean that the harvest in 2010 was even lower than in 2011 for some households.\\nWhile the remarkable increase in precipitation over the past few years was confi rmed in both Bandiagara and Linguère, the local people assessed its impacts within the study areas very differently. Moreover, the interviewees also mentioned other factors determining yields, such as the access to seeds, pesticides and fertiliser, as well as their appropriate application, generally decreasing soil fertility and lack of agricultural land, equipment and labour force. 15 These fi rst results show that the total amount of precipitation can only refl ect a modest indicator of a \\'good\\' rainy season and does not necessarily translate into better harvests and increasing food security for everyone. Moreover, it is essential to consider the cultural dimension of people\\'s representation of climate (Hulme 2008 ;Peterson and Broad 2009 ). Therefore, Roncoli argues \"an inquiry into the cultural meaning that underlies farmers\\' understandings of climate, both its ordinary and abnormal manifestations, is a necessary fi rst step in climate application studies\" ( 2006 , p. 84). Important aspects that can deepen insights into assessments of climate include examining local terminologies and calendars for the different seasons (Orlove et al. 2004 ), or the exploration of local classifi cations and types of rainfall (Roncoli et al. 2002 ). Our respondents in both countries highlighted the impact of the timing and distribution of rainfall, which shows that \"unlike scientists, these farmers think about rainfall as a process rather than as a quantity\" (see p. 84 in Roncoli 2006 ). Given that a multitude of factors besides rainfall have an effect on yields, it is clear that climate can only be of limited explanatory power with respect to people\\'s vulnerability (Mertz et al. 2009 ).',\n",
       "  'Vegetation': 'Since the mid-1980s, remote sensing has detected a greening trend in large parts of the African Sahel, contesting the notion of widespread degradation (Anyamba and Tucker 2005 ;Olsson et al. 2005 ). Moreover, rainfall seems to be only one of the important causative factors for this recovery from the great droughts (Herrmann et al. 2005 ). While the data on local vegetation changes available for our two study sites does not provide conclusive explanations regarding the contribution of climate factors, it does provide an idea of general regional vegetation and land use trends over the past 50 years.\\nLinguère is located in the transitional zone of three ecological regions with different soil and vegetation characteristics (see Tappan et al. 2004 ). Depending on the soil type (e.g. deep sandy soils or shallow loamy and gravelly soils over laterite), there are considerable local differences in the agricultural potential as well as the mortality of woody plants (ibid.; see also Vincke et al. 2010 ). Generally, the trends indicate a signifi cant expansion of cropping land and a moderate loss of woody cover since 1965, but a relative stability since 1983. In Bandiagara, two major zones can be distinguished, with the Dogon plateau characterised by rocky soils and the Séno plain by deep sandy soils. Signifi cant losses of tree cover have been detected in the region during the past 40 years, albeit with considerable divergence in different areas (MEA 2009 ). Another study focusing particularly on Bandiagara describes the enormous encroachment of rain-fed agriculture and associated disappearance of natural woodlands for the same period, yet highlighting the recent success of governmental and villagers\\' efforts to preserve woody plants within agricultural lands (Yossi and Diakité 2008 ).\\nRegarding long-term changes in vegetation cover, local populations in both study areas report a tremendous decrease of woodlands since the beginning of the 1970s. For example, elders in Mali told us about dense forests during the time of their childhood. The interviewees related the disappearance of tree cover to the persistent water scarcity during the great droughts on the one hand, and extensive deforestation during that period to compensate for harvest losses by selling wood on the other. 16 A major change observed by the people is a decrease in the diversity of tree species: \"Today you have to walk long distances to fi nd certain medical plants and trees, some of them have completely disappeared.\" 17 Trees within agricultural fi elds are preserved by the villagers themselves and appear to be crucial for them: \"Where there are more trees, there is also more rainfall. Everyone wants to have trees on his fi elds, because it increases soil fertility and one gets a better harvest.\" 18 In both countries, people evaluated soil fertility as having decreased during the past 50 years, which they do not associate with a defi ciency of trees but rather with shortened or even no fallow periods as a result of insuffi cient cultivable land.\\nThese local assessments of vegetation change in the study areas reveal that, despite the enormous decline of woodlands since the great droughts and increasing preservation efforts being confi rmed by the local populations, there seems to be a discrepancy in the evaluation of recent vegetation trends, attesting a general greening and relative stability of woody plants. Interestingly, none of the interviewees highlighted a stability or increase of trees in the study regions; rather, they emphasised the lack of trees, high population pressure on woody plants, as well as offi cial restrictions and penalties related to woodcutting. This is in line with the fi ndings of Mertz et al. ( 2009 , p. 810) in Senegal, where people perceive a degradation of vegetation and do not relate it to climate but mainly to abusive use and population growth. Even if the woody vegetation is recovering in our study regions, cutting fi rewood is restricted to certain areas, requires a costly offi cial permission and therefore remains a source of confl ict and concern to many people, which thus might infl uence their personal assessment of vegetation trends.\\nIn this section we have discussed contemporary tendencies regarding climate conditions and vegetation trends in the two study areas, providing interpretations of these trends by the local population. Even though detailed information on smaller spatial scales is not available yet, data from meteorological observation 19 and fi eld research in the region generally point to positive trends towards more precipitation and a relative stability of vegetation cover (Tappan et al. 2004 ;Yossi and Diakité 2008 ). While people\\'s observations of the past profound changes in rainfall and vegetation correspond to recorded data, their assessments of current trends do not draw a uniform picture and seem to be infl uenced by the diverse impacts these trends may have. People interpret and feel affected by the changes very differently, and name a variety of non-climate factors on which their food security and livelihoods depend. Harvest output is a result of an interplay of parameters that goes beyond rainfall and the diversifi cation of income generating activities essentially contributes to people\\'s livelihoods. It is clear that annual temperature, annual rainfall or overall vegetation cover are not adequate and suffi cient parameters for making judgments with regard to the impact of climate on people\\'s lives on a local level.',\n",
       "  'Hoe and Mobile Phone: Local Migration Dynamics': 'The high mobility of people in the study areas has a long tradition and must be regarded in the historical context of West African migration dynamics (see de Haas 2007 ;Merabet and Gendreau 2007 ). Contemporary migration patterns in West Africa are shaped by colonial infl uence. The introduction of taxes and the high labour demand in coffee, cacao and groundnut plantations, mines or for large infrastructural projects have led to the development of a rural-rural and rural-urban circular labour migration pattern that is mainly directed from landlocked countries such as Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali towards the coastal regions of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria (Bakewell and de Haas 2007 ). Fast-growing urban centres and especially harbour towns such as Accra, Lagos, Abidjan, Lomé, Dakar and Cotonou have emerged as important economic points of attraction for job-seeking migrants. Environmental and climatic conditions have always contributed to shaping the causal, temporal and spatial dimensions of human migration in the region. For example, a north-south rainfall gradient implies that regions in the south generally have more favourable conditions for crop production, thus supporting a north-southdirected agricultural and labour migration. Moreover, annual transhumant movements performed by Fulani pastoralists or the dry-season migration practised by sedentary, agriculturalist rural households are well-known migration strategies of adaptation to the effects of seasonality of rainfall and periodic droughts characteristic to the West African Sahel (see p. 451 in McLeman and Hunter 2010 ).',\n",
       "  'Migration in Bandiagara': 'Our results confi rm that Bamako and the Ivory Coast are primary destinations for migrants from Bandiagara; moreover, apart from a few exceptions, international migration beyond Africa seems to be of lesser importance. Bamako has become an increasingly important destination thanks to rising job opportunities,20 particularly in the informal sector. 21 Much migration from Bandiagara appears to be temporary and circular, both within Mali and abroad. In most of the villages, a tendency towards the longer absence (temporary) or intensifi ed emigration (permanent) of young people, especially to Bamako, is associated with an increasing literacy rate and the lack of institutions of higher education or relevant employment opportunities. 22 As with many other ethnic groups in West Africa, migration as a \"rite de passage\" to adulthood is also an integral part of the Dogon people\\'s culture in Bandiagara, whereby virtually all young men temporarily leave their village to \"go on adventure\" (Dougnon 2007 ;see p. 62 in Doevenspeck 2005 ): \"It\\'s the chat. If you didn\\'t travel, you have nothing to tell. […] Besides, you feel less annoyed because you have experienced many things.\" 23 Usually, who is allowed to migrate and for how long is negotiated within the household, in order to keep at least a mini-mum of manpower at home. Young people repeatedly mentioned the lack of income opportunities in their rural home as a migration motive. For many interviewees, paying taxes, purchasing animals or farming equipment, a mobile phone or a motorbike are important objectives that can be realised through migration. 24The only connection between environmental and climatic factors and migration that the people established themselves was through describing an increase of seasonal labour migrants as one of their strategies to compensate for insuffi cient harvests caused by \\'bad\\' rainfall (see Sect. 5.4.2 ). However, as Findley ( 1994 ) has shown for the drought from 1983 to 1985, short-distance, temporary migration as a response to variations in the rainfall regime of the region is not new. Even though dry-season migration is still more important, the seasonal circular movements seem to take on increasingly heterogeneous temporary patterns, with people commuting at all times of the year. 25 Depending on the individual situation, they may return to the home village for less than 3 months per year, or stay away for several years and only pay short visits to the village for family events or whenever important community affairs have to be settled. 26 Interviewees reported that migrants\\' remittances play an important role regarding food security, especially for poorer households, since yields are insuffi cient to supply the families throughout the year. However, interviews in Bandiagara revealed that harvests crucially depend on a multitude of other factors in addition to rain, including the specifi c location of fi elds, crop diversifi cation and the degree of mechanisation. At this point, it is important to note that temporary migration is only one of various income generating activities mentioned, along with petty trade, vegetable gardening, selling animals, wild fruits and plant leaves as animal feed, or selling wood and charcoal. In a sense, all these activities can be regarded as adaptation strategies both to climate variability and economic hardship.',\n",
       "  'Migration in Linguère': 'Results show that mobility patterns in the area of Linguère are principally characterised by internal migration towards the cities and international migration towards Europe. By far the most prominent destination among the urban centres is Dakar. Even though repetitive temporary movements persist at present, young people nowadays seek to settle down permanently in the city. The most frequently cited motives for migrating to the urban centre were the same as in Bandiagara, namely education and proper employment and income opportunities. 27 One interviewee explained that anyone who fi nds a permanent job in town does not return to the village easily. A further reason is surely that movements from Linguère to the cities have persisted since colonial times, thus strengthening migration networks over a long period, which again perpetuates migration to this day. 28 Elders with their own migration experience emphasised the \\'bright-light effect\\' of the big city: \"Those people who are doing agriculture and think that agriculture is good and suffi cient don\\'t know anything and haven\\'t seen the big cities. […] They haven\\'t seen much in their life.\" 29Although people in Linguère critically evaluate the emigration of young people by hinting at the subsequent increased workload on the farms for their elders, they also appreciate the importance of education and the positive effects of young people\\'s migrations, as well as the importance of remittances, with typical statements including: \"If you abandon school, you abandon your family\"30 or \"Someone who lives in the city and sends money is closer to the family than someone who stays at home without means.\" 31Interviewees also made statements concerning environmental and climatic aspects in connection with migration. For instance, one migrant from Nguith in Dakar said that the formerly seasonal migration from his village to Dakar began to take on a permanent character following the onset of the droughts at the beginning of the 1970s, owing to decreasing yields. The community\\'s specialisation in basket making in Dakar permitted them to become increasingly independent from harvest output in the village. The chiefs of the villages of Kadji and Khogué specifi ed that some young people were returning to their villages and becoming reengaged in farming at the time of the investigation, due to the particularly abundant rainfalls in 2009 and 2010. 32 Even though the detailed circumstances remain unknown, it can certainly be assumed that they did not have a permanent and rewarding income in Dakar and might have returned to the capital in 2011. Another farmer from Linguère, when fi rst interviewed in 2011, emphasised his profi table engagement in agriculture. In 2012, he was encountered in Dakar, explaining that he had decided to abandon the last cropping period following a bad onset of rainfall in 2011. Thanks to family contacts and his migration experience in Dakar, he had secured work assisting a cousin in his mobile phone shop. Such examples highlight that fl uctuations in the amount and timing of rainfall are contributing factors in decisions for temporary internal movements, which are less regarded as a problem but rather a usual mode of living in a very mobile and multi-local social environment under variable climatic conditions. However, our data indicate that migration to Europe does not seem to have a causal relation to climate or environmental factors (cf. Jónsson 2010 ).\\nThe contemporary migration landscape is still largely shaped by historically established patterns, with most population movements taking place within the country or region. A common, albeit not new phenomenon in both societies is the trend towards increasing emigration to the cities, and capitals in particular, which people do not primarily associate with climate and environmental factors. Dry-season migration is a well-known and important strategy of adaptation to the annual variability of climatic conditions of the region. However, there are also increasingly complex and ambiguous temporal patterns of circular migration. As shown by the remarks made in some of the interviews, the variability of precipitation (for instance, the drought of the 1970s or the varying patterns of rainfall in recent years) affects migration dynamics to a certain extent. Moreover, it also became evident that in this case migration is not the only adaptation strategy and that there can be enormous differences in the migration dynamics of different villages. The motives behind migration decisions are very complex and multi-layered, even if some respondents directly mentioned aspects of rainfall trends when explaining migration decisions.',\n",
       "  'Bringing People and Places Back in: Local Insights in Climate, Environment and Migration': \"In this chapter, we have adopted a local perspective to explore the relationship between climate, environment and migration in two regions of Mali and Senegal where population mobility is high and processes of environmental degradation are said to increase people's vulnerability. We have shown that seasonal and temporary migration patterns in Bandiagara and Linguère have been traditionally adapted to climatic conditions, long before the international debate on the consequences of global climate change started. Migration in this sense is a well-established strategy to adapt to seasonality and variability of rainfall (Findley 1994 ;de Haan et al. 2002 ), but likewise must be regarded as an adaptation to processes of economic, social and cultural change. This places the focus of this volume's discussion on the multiple dimensions of local contexts in which climatic and environmental change and population movements occur. Empirically, two preliminary conclusions can be drawn from our results. Local climate variability continues to impact migration, especially the magnitude of seasonal movements, although it seems that the same climate trends do not result in the same migration responses.\\nFor example, increased rainfall in 2009 and 2010 contributed to the return of migrants to Linguère, whereas by contrast, negative impacts of the higher rainfall on harvests have played a part in increased numbers of seasonal migrants in Bandiagara. However, it is evident that the contemporary migration landscape is very much shaped by historically established mobility patterns and networks. In this respect, education and income opportunities in urban centres, 'going on an adventure' and returning to the village with a mobile phone or a motorbike for prestige reasons refl ect widespread migration motives. The destination and length of migration heavily depend on the migrant's assets, thus rendering migration a socially differentiated and selective process that does not provide a homogeneous image of patterns, destinations, objectives and motives. Complex migration patterns are embedded in an environment that, when looking at quantitative representations of rainfall and vegetation trends on a larger scale, seems to be undergoing continuous recovery from the effects of the great Sahelian droughts of the past century. However, by considering the cultural dimension of climate, people's assessments show that the timing and distribution of rainfall, or even the number of trees in the fi eld, may be more essential than increasing mean annual precipitation. People in different places feel differently affected by recent changes in climate conditions, further stating that climate is only one of many factors that affect their livelihoods.\\nIt must be recalled that the conceptual constraints in approaching the complexity of the environment-migration nexus imply methodological diffi culties. During research, it became evident that a clear distinction between cognitive perception and people's own assessment of climate and environmental parameters is hardly possible. The answers provided by the respondents are highly biased by the impacts of climate and vegetation changes on their individual situation. Cultural aspects, experiences and concernments all impact local assessments of climate and environment (see also Roncoli 2006 ). Therefore, this chapter proposes an approach that conceptually and methodically separates the two research topics of migration and climate/ environment. Separate research on local interpretations of climate and environmental changes allows us to deepen our comprehension of their cultural meanings and relevance for people's daily lives, rather than targeting climate variability and environmental degradation as a problem per se that requires migration as an answer. This approach is complemented by the inclusion of migrants at their current place of residence abroad, in an attempt to grasp mobility as a normality, a routinised practice of everyday life, as opposed to considering it as a mere coping strategy, a reaction to a concrete threat in the area of origin.\\nIn this respect, the present study contributes to the current debate on climate and environment as drivers of migration in the West African Sahel by presenting both a local representation of migration and a local assessment of climate and environment. Considering the local level empirically and contrasting climate trends and environmental changes in the study regions with assessments by local people allows comparison with similar approaches (see Mertz et al. 2009 ;West et al. 2008 ;Maddison 2007 ). The multi-sited approach of presenting local people's views on migration from the study areas can provide information concerning migration motives and helps to show that contemporary mobility must not be regarded predominantly as an adaptation strategy in the face of environmental or climate stress. Given this complex framework of mobility and local assessment of climate and vegetation trends in the study areas, it becomes evident that, as discussed above, concepts adopting a disentangled view on climate as the main driver of population movements are misleading. Rather, it is important to develop a deeper understanding of local meanings of environmental change and migration in the context of multiple social, political and economic processes of change in order to understand if, how and to what extent certain climate and vegetation trends play a role for what kind of migration.\"},\n",
       " 26: {'abstract': 'There is increasing consensus that the effects of extreme weather conditions in the form of drought, flooding and extreme temperature will have increasingly devastating impacts on those who depend on climate-sensitive resources and ecosystems for their livelihoods. The most affected will be the poor in developing countries who have a low adaptive capacity to climate change due to high poverty levels. Despite these projections, there are, to date, insufficient empirical studies linking the relationship between climate change and migration, particularly in the context of southern Africa. Using field-based data collected from two study locations in Zambia, this paper examines the complex relationship between extreme weather events and population movement. It is envisaged that the findings presented in this paper will contribute to current discussions on the complex relationship between extreme weather conditions and population movement specifically in the context of sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"One of the emerging debates within migration studies concerns the relationship between climate change and migration. Environmental degradation resulting from processes such as desertification, ecological deterioration and loss of biodiversity are, arguably, major factors that compromise the ability of individuals and whole communities, particularly the poor, to obtain sustainable livelihoods (Potter et al., 2008). It is also argued that although such individuals and communities have developed various adaptive strategies to reduce the impacts arising from environmental stress, there is increasing evidence that local knowledge is becoming inadequate to deal with the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events (such as floods and drought) (Singh, 2000).\\nWithin the broad subject of migration, for example, there is a growing literature that aims to document the migration-environment relationship. However, there is still no consensus on how the two themes are connected due to inadequate evidence on the causes of environmental change, and the general lack of appropriate data for analysing such relationships (Black, 2001). Renaud et al. (2007, p. 11) argue that 'the evidence put forward so far to link environmental factors to forced migration is often not scientifically or factually rigorous and has been dismissed by the detractors of the concept' (see also Black, 2001). Contrary to this argument, Castles (2002) states that environmental factors can be very important in triggering population movement in certain circumstances. This view is supported by Oliver-Smith (2006) who observes that nature (which can be understood as the co-existence of nature and society) could be among several factors triggering population movement.\\nThe lack of consensus on the migration-environment relationship stems from how the concepts of environmental change and/or degradation have been conceptualised. But a much bigger problem, as observed by Henry (n.d.), has been how to identify individuals or groups of people that can be considered 'environmental migrants'. Renaud et al. (2007, p. 11), for example, argue that 'there is no accepted definition of what an environmental migrant is'. The main reason for the lack of a definition is linked to the difficulty of isolating environmental factors from other drivers of migration, such as economic, cultural or social conflicts. Dun and Gemenne (2008), however, argue that environmental migration commonly presents itself where there is a slow-onset of environmental change or degradation process affecting people who are directly dependent on the environment for their livelihood and causing them livelihood stress.\\nIn view of the above observations, this paper uses empirical data from 30 households of Tonga 1 migrants from Southern Province of Zambia to examine how perceived changes in climatic conditions triggered their movement to Central Province. Emphasis is placed on how extreme weather events such as drought and occasional flooding impacted their livelihood systems as well as their general well-being and therefore acted as triggers for their movement. The paper aims to raise some important empirical evidence that will contribute to contemporary debates on climate change and migration and inform policy formulation in a wider context of developing countries, with specific relevance to Zambia.\",\n",
       "  'Methodological issues': \"The paper is based on data that was collected using a participatory research methodology. The research was carried out between November 2009 and March 2010 in Mukonchi and Lunchu settlements in Central Province 2 with 30 Tonga migrant households originally from Southern Province. The 30 households were also part of an earlier study conducted between May and August 2003, which involved 400 households in Zambia's Southern Province. This earlier study used the post-harvest survey 3 data and investigated the impacts of post-structural adjustment programmes on food production and food security in four selected districts (Choma, Kalomo, Monze and Sinazongwe) of Southern Zambia.\\nIt is important to bear in mind that the 30 migrant households on which this paper is based may not be representative of the original study sample (that is, the 400 households). However, they are all closely linked to Southern Province both socially and culturally. For purposes of this paper, the 30 households must be considered as outliers of the original study population. It is also important to note that the 2003 study highlighted a number of issues that required further investigation particularly in aspects relating to how local people were adjusting and coping with extreme weather conditions. It is in this context that in 2008 the authors of this paper conducted another study that examined the various adaptation strategies employed by some of the 2003 research participants against extreme weather conditions. It was during the 2008 study that it was further discovered that some of the individuals and households interviewed in 2003 had migrated across district and provincial boundaries to other parts of Zambia.\\nA follow-up study was thus conducted between 1 November 2009 and 30 March 2010 to identify those people who had migrated from Southern Province to other parts of the country. The purpose of the study was to investigate factors and processes that motivated and triggered the relocation of the 30 migrant households from four districts in Southern Province to Lunchu and Mukonchi in Central Province (see Map 1). Using existing contacts from both the origin and destination areas, eight households were initially identified by the researchers as having migrated to Central Province. Of these households, five had settled in the Mukonchi area while three had settled in the Lunchu area (see Map 1). Having identified these households, we decided to contact each of the eight households by mobile phone and then visit them at their respective farmsteads between 1 November 2009 and 30 March 2010. On these visits we talked to members of the households to ascertain what factors had motivated their movement across district and provincial boundaries. 4  Initial discussions with the eight migrant households resulted in the identification of an additional seven households in Mukonchi and 15 households in Lunchu, all of which were part of the 2003 study. This brought the total number of research participant households in both Lunchu and Mukonchi areas to 30. Focus group discussions were held with members of each household, and data was collected using tools inspired by the tradition of participatory research. These included transect walks, matrices, listing of general problems, ranking and brainstorming activities. The participatory research methods were complemented by semistructured interviews using open-ended questions. All discussions were conducted in Tonga. 5  It is acknowledged that a comparison of views between those households that migrated from Southern Province and those that did not may have added value to the argument presented here. But the interest of this paper is on understanding the views of the movers and not the stayers. Thus, it primarily discusses the reasons for migrating and not for staying in the areas of origin. Such a comparison will be the focus of a forthcoming paper.\\nThere were two common characteristics of all the 30 participant households in this study. First, they had all migrated from Southern Zambia (as shown in Map 1). 7 Second, they were all directly dependent on agricultural production and livestock as their primary source of livelihood, both in their emigration and immigration areas. The field-based data was complemented by a limited amount of station data on rainfall and temperature collected from the Meteorological Department of Zambia and other sources. This enabled us to triangulate the views that were expressed by the 30 migrant households.\",\n",
       "  'Some theoretical perspectives': 'Migration, according to Fellmann et al. (1995, p. 82), may be forced or voluntary, or, in many instances, reluctant relocations imposed on the migrants by circumstances. The founding father of modern migration research and analysis, E.G. Ravenstein (1885), suggested that migration is caused by economic development. This argument is supported by Todaro (2000, p. 305) who is of the view that, \\'migrants consider various labour market opportunities available to them in the rural and urban sectors and choose the one that maximises their expected gains from migration\\'. The major weakness in this argument is the emphasis on economic factors and wealth maximisation and the neglect of other factors such as environmental processes, kinship and social ties, and security issues. Within these perspectives, there is a general tendency to portray a potential migrant as an unconstrained actor whose motives to migrate are solely influenced by economic factors (Castles and Miller, 2009). This conventional way of categorising population movement impedes our understanding of the nature and drivers of migration processes. The simple categories and dichotomies suggested by classic theories of migration to characterise population movements primarily in economic terms reflect bureaucratic and legal taxonomies that conceal the often complex, mixed and shifting motivations of migrants.\\nThere is now a movement towards studying contemporary migration processes from a theoretical perspective that involves three levels of analysis; the macro, meso and micro levels. The three levels of analysis provide a more comprehensive framework from which to identify structures or mechanisms/factors that influence the decision to migrate (see Cliggett, 2000;Massey et al., 1993). The micro level, for example, rests on the assumption that the decision to migrate or not to is entirely a matter of choice for a potential migrant. An individual or group of individuals make decisions based on their autonomy and freedom of choice aimed at improving and securing their lifestyle, status, comfort, wealth, stimulation and affiliation. At the micro level, the decision to migrate is conceptually perceived as a function reflecting the potential migrants\\' values, desires and expectations in both areas of emigration and immigration (see Cliggett, 2000;Massey et al., 1993;Maystadt and Mueller, 2012).\\nThe macro level focuses on opportunity structures and explains the decision to migrate from economic, political, cultural, demographic or ecological perspectives (Massey et al., 1993). According to the analysis at this level, political, economic, cultural and ecological structures denote an array of factors in the emigration and destination areas. Massey et al. (1993), supported by Castles (2002), observe that the macro level analyses migration from a triadic relationship between governments and authorities in the emigration and immigration areas, the migrants\\' associations and sometimes international organisations, all of which have varying degrees of influence on the decision to migrate.\\nThe meso level focuses on a set of social and symbolic ties among movers and groups, and the resources available to them (Massey et al., 1993;Maystadt and Mueller, 2012). The analysis here is anchored in the structure, strength and density of social ties on the one hand, and their content on the other hand. The decision to migrate is seen as a rational decision facilitated by the social and symbolic ties among stayers and migrants, with units and networks in the areas of origin and destination, and their relations between collective actors: for example, inter alia kinship groups, religious groups, households, ethnic communities and nations (Massey et al., 1993;Maystadt and Mueller, 2012).\\nAlthough there may be other approaches that could be employed to explain various population movements, the value of the micro, macro and meso levels of analysis cannot be underestimated, particularly when investigating the relationship between migration patterns and environmental factors. Studies such as those done by Dun and Gemenne (2008), Renaud et al. (2007) and Castles (2002) allude to the fact that there is evidence suggesting that environmental hazards are increasingly displacing large sectors of the population globally. Hunter (2005), for example, suggests that: \\'[. . .] over the last two decades, environmental disasters have displaced increasing numbers of people\\'. She further points out that, \\'natural calamities also often \"push\" migrants from rural to urban areas [. . .] such that an unusual increase of beggars and people looking for work in cities and towns is part of the aftermath of such calamities\\' (Hunter, 2005, p. 274).\\nEl-Hinnawi (1985) and Jacobson (1988) have used the term \\'environmental refugees\\' to denote people forced to leave their homes temporarily or permanently due to environmental problems that either threatened or compromised their quality of life (see also Myers and Kent, 1995). However, the term, as observed by Black (2001), has been vigorously criticised by scholars such as McGregor (1993) and Kibreab (1994) for being poorly defined and legally meaningless and confusing. Black (2001) observes that:\\nAlthough environmental degradation and catastrophe may be important factors in the decision to migrate, and issues of concern in their own right, their conceptualisations as a primary cause of forced displacement is unhelpful and unsound intellectually, and unnecessary in practical terms (Black, 2001, p. 1).\\nHowever, using a 15-year panel data to explore the relationship between population mobility, flooding and crop failure in rural Bangladesh, Maystadt and Mueller (2012) argue that drought rather than flooding had the strongest effects on mobility. They further observe that, \\'households in communities with widespread exposure to drought are more likely to move than ones limited to their own, personal exposure\\' (Maystadt and Mueller, 2012, p. 3).\\nRegardless of the deficiencies in definitions and conceptualisation of who an environmental migrant is, the most crucial question is how does environmental change influence the decision to migrate? While there may be more than one answer to this question, El-Hinnawi (1985) and Castles (2002) both observe that environmental change can force people to migrate (temporarily or permanently) over a period of time when the environment is their only source of livelihood (see also Henry, n.d.;Reuveny, 2005). Ezra and Kiros (2001), for example, argue that a community\\'s vulnerability to food shortages as a result of uncertain natural environments may lead some households to migrate as a family\\'s coping strategy. This view is supported by Osterling (1979, p. 120), who argues that, \\'most migrants were compelled to seek employment through migration because the natural disaster had intensified traditional poverty in their villages of origin\\'. Maystadt and Mueller (2012) also observe that households send migrants to work to reduce the potential losses caused by natural disasters at home. Furthermore, Hugo (1996) and Jacobson (1998) are of the view that environmental decline, especially in developing regions, may be an important \\'push\\' factor fuelling urbanisation. It is important to note that where environmental changes do influence the decision to migrate, they must not be understood in isolation of other processes taking place at all levels of society. Osterling (1979), for example, argues that:\\n[. . .] migrants were innovative in responding to the earthquake by capitalising on social networks that facilitated migration to Huayopampa, which is seen as a training ground for preparation for an eventual permanent move to Lima (Osterling, 1979, p. 120).\\nThe discussion above suggests that there is an increase in the consensus that environmental factors do play a role in triggering population mobility. Studies such as those done by Homer-Dixon (1994), Myers (1988), Myers and Kent (1995), Ramlogan (1996), Trolldalen et al. (1992) and, more recently, Dillon et al. (2011), Gray and Mueller (2012a;2012b) and Marchiori et al. (2012) indicate that exposure and vulnerability to weather variations interact and link population mobility to environmental factors. While this may be the case, there are still very strong arguments regarding the lack of empirical studies that clearly demonstrate the relationship between environmental change and migration. Black (2001), for example, argues that there is no convincing evidence that environmental change leads to large-scale population displacement. Using the case of desertification in the Sahel zone and similar regions, he argues that migration in these areas has been a coping strategy for people for centuries and that it is an essential part of the economic and social structure of the region, rather than a response to environmental decline (Black, 1998). Similarly, Piguet et al. (2011) observe that little progress has been made with respect to quantifying the consequences of environmental migration, and that quite often dramatic consequences are asserted for political reasons and not based enough on evidence.\\nThe above viewpoints provide a useful framework for studying and analysing the relationship between environmental change and migration, but the focus of this paper is not to define who an environmental migrant is, or to categorise such migrants\\' attributes. Instead, the paper aims to contribute to contemporary discussions and understanding of how perceived environmental factors associated to extreme weather conditions can combine with other processes to trigger population movement.',\n",
       "  'A brief overview of population movements in Zambia': \"Figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Zambia for the period 1998-2010 suggest a shift in population movement with a decrease in the traditional rural-urban flows and an increase in urban-to-urban and rural-to-rural migrations. These changes in movement seem to have coincided with deteriorations in all sub-sectors of the economy arising from the decline in global prices and demand for copper, which forms the mainstay of Zambia's economy.\\nAlthough urban-to-urban migration has remained the dominant form of population change in urban areas of Zambia, rural-to-rural and urban-to-rural as well as rural-to-urban movements are slowly becoming prevalent and are increasing in importance (See Table 1).\\nWhile different factors may be responsible for the contemporary patterns in population mobility in Zambia, it is plausible to argue that current stagnations and deteriorations in all sub-sectors of the Zambian economy, particularly in the mining sector-traditionally the largest employer-have contributed to the observed migratory patterns (CSO, 2005(CSO, , 2010)). What is intriguing, however, is that the re-ordering of population movement (for example the urban to rural from 11 per cent in 1998 to 18 per cent in 2009/10) has coincided with huge international investments in the mining industry due to revived global demand for copper, which has resulted in increased copper prices (see Figure 1). Source: CSO (1998CSO ( , 1999CSO ( , 2004CSO ( , 2005CSO ( and 2010)).\\nIn view of this development in the copper industry, one would expect a high influx of migrants and movement towards Copperbelt Province, which traditionally has been one of the two dominant and preferred final destinations-the other being Lusaka-for many migrants. Yet, the emerging pattern, which is skewed towards the less economically developed provinces, requires a rethinking of the factors underlying population movement in Zambia.\\nIn 1999, for example, of the total 136,012 migrants in Central Province, nine per cent had migrated from other urban centres of Zambia, while during the period 2002 to 2005 the number involved in a similar movement rose from 19 per cent to 24 per cent (CSO, 2004(CSO, , 2005)). Overall, official statistics suggest that migration in Zambia is no longer largely responsive to the purported traditional pull of the economy because the locus of poverty, as observed by Milimo et al. (2002) and Simatele and Simatele (2009), has shifted to include urban areas. This is because urban areas no longer provide the security that they once offered due to high unemployment rates as well as the high cost of living.\\nA study carried out by the World Bank ( 2007) on urban poverty and vulnerability in Zambia, for example, reveals that 92 per cent of respondents classified themselves as 'very poor' or 'moderately poor'. Factors identified as attributing to their poverty included general economic conditions of the country, lack of employment opportunities, low wages, lack of capital to start or expand their business enterprise, and high cost of urban living. By contrast, however, official figures from the CSO, as argued by Chibuye (2011), show that urban poverty levels increased from 49 per cent in 1991 to 56 per cent in 1998, but fell significantly thereafter, from 53 per cent in 2004 to 34 per cent in 2006. Despite this decrease, the unprecedented reduction (19 per cent) in urban poverty between 2004 and 2006 has raised controversy (Chibuye, 2011;Simatele and Simatele, 2009). No clear explanations have been offered as to why poverty is shown to have fallen so dramatically within a two-year period (Chibuye, 2011).\\nAlthough there have been increased interest and investment in the copper mines in Zambia, the impact of these large-scale mining activities on local communities has largely been negative. Simutayi (2008), citing Dansereau (2007), argues that they have contributed to social conflict, the destruction of livelihoods, the dislocation and displacement of local communities and environmental damage. It must be noted, however, that mining can also have a positive impact on the local economy, which in turn would act as a pull factor for migrants. The new mining activities in Zambia have the potential to stimulate economic activities through sub-contracting services and supplying goods, thereby creating employment opportunities for local people and improving the livelihoods of the local community.\\nHowever, the development agreements signed between the Zambian government and the new owners of the privatised mining companies allow them to reduce costs in order to increase profitability (Simutayi, 2008). To do this, mines have scaled down on employment and little has been done to compel the new mine owners to engage more permanent employees. Simultaneously, working conditions in the privatised mines have deteriorated and are thus not attractive to potential migrants.\",\n",
       "  'From Southern Province to Mukonchi and Lunchu in Central Province': \"Until the early 1990s, Southern Province was known for its ideal farming conditions. It was known as the bread basket of Zambia and supplied the country's staple food crop (maize) (Cligget, 2000). Many of the farming activities in this region, particularly small-scale and peasant farming, are dependent on rainfall and any changes in precipitation have negative effects on agricultural productivity (Kasali, 2007;Milimo et al., 2002). The weather in Southern Province and over Zambia as a whole is influenced by the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). During the rainy season (November to April) the ITCZ moves over the area on a day-to-day basis, always resuming its standard position. This then leads to intervals of rainfall and dry days (see Kasali, 2007). After the ITCZ has moved further north and the retreat movements are no longer compensated for, strong south-easterly winds spring up and bring dry air. During the next few months (May to September) there is a high-pressure belt over Zambia especially in Southern Province, which results in dry weather conditions.\\nOver the past four decades, the ITCZ has slowly moved northwards to the equator, thereby resulting in increased rainfall variability and reduced rain days across Zambia as a whole (see Table 2). It is suggested in Table 2 that of all the nine provinces Source: Kasali (2007).\\nin Zambia, Southern receives the least annual average rainfall (737 millimetres) and has the fewest rain days (41) compared to other provinces such as Central, which receives an average of 1,192 millimetres, and North-Western, which receives an average of 1,173 millimetres. Within Southern Province, the districts of Choma, Kalomo, Mazabuka and Monze have been home to many subsistence as well as 'emergent' 8 farmers, who have traditionally depended on rain-fed agriculture (Simatele, 2006). It would be plausible to argue, then, that climate variability in the form of reduced rainfall and drought episodes, particularly in the 1990s, has subjected a significant number of Tonga farming households to harsh environmental conditions. These weather conditions, according to Simatele (2006) and Milimo et al. (2002), have resulted in reduced crop yields, loss of livestock and other assets, 9 and have contributed to corresponding increases in poverty.\\nTable 3 is a summary of the main weather conditions identified by the 30 migrant households in Lunchu and Mukonchi as constraining their farming activities in Southern Province or influencing their decision to migrate to Lunchu and Mukonchi in Central Zambia.\\nTable 3 suggests that 35 per cent of the responses identified drought episodes as a major weather event that constrained the research participants' involvement in agriculture, while intense heat was identified second and statistically represented at 28 per cent. Further discussions with the participants revealed that the impacts of drought had devastating impacts, particularly on cereal crops such as maize, which forms the main source of livelihood and household incomes. A female participant aged between 30 and 40 years who migrated to Lunchu from Monze with her family in the 1990s stated:\\nIt was very difficult to cultivate any crops in Monze because of poor rainfall. The soils were always too hard to till, the water-wells and rivers frequently dried up, and we were frequently finding ourselves in desperate situations as we had no food.\\nAnother participant aged between 40 and 50, who originally migrated from Mazabuka and settled in Mukonchi area, stated: My problems in Mazabuka were bigger than the ocean. I now have no oxen, no goats and no plates or chairs. The cattle I had before I migrated here died from starvation and thirst due to drought. I was forced to search for better pastures and farming land to save both my few remaining animals and family.\\nThe two views expressed above suggest that drought played a significant role in the decision by the two research participants to migrate. In both cases droughts not only compromised their livelihoods but also eroded some of their important assets. The erosion of these productive assets, coupled with poor rainfall, compromised the ability of these individuals (and whole communities) to obtain meaningful livelihoods. This situation may have facilitated the need for them to relocate to central Zambia in search of better livelihood options. If this assertion holds true, it is plausible to argue that the need to migrate to areas of less environmental stress is an appropriate fit with the micro and macro levels of analysis as stipulated in the three-tier theoretical framework above. Of particular relevance here is the reference by the two research participants to the need for asset protection (animals and land) as well as improved access to secure and sustainable livelihood options. This confirms the argument presented in the three-tier theoretical framework of migration analysis that would-be environmental migrants and their decision to migrate is triggered by a combination of factors, among which are ecological factors, personal values and aspirations, and desires and expectations of opportunities that may be present in both emigration and immigration destinations.\\nTable 4 shows the listing and ranking exercise done by three focus groups in Lunchu, demonstrating how drought episodes affected different resources that constituted their main sources of livelihoods in their original areas of emigration in Southern Province.\\nTable 4 indicates that drought not only affected agricultural production but also resulted in the loss of financial resources, statistically represented by 30 per cent and 24 per cent of all responses respectively. We can therefore argue that although climate variability was an important factor in influencing the decision to migrate, the loss in financial resources in the form of household income appears to have been another significant contributing factor. This scenario seems to be a natural fit with suggestions in most of the literature on population movement that migration is a function of economic processes (see Castle and Miller, 2009;Todaro, 2000).\\nThe three-tier framework of analysis discussed above also identifies economic issues as one of the key factors influencing the decision by potential migrants to move to new areas. It is important to note that economic processes are often shaped by a complex combination of factors, among which political processes are paramount. Collinson (2009), for example, observes that patterns and dynamics of migration are highly varied, complex and context specific. Understanding these dynamics in specific contexts might be improved by exploring the interaction of local-level factors immediately influencing peoples' migration decisions and strategies (linked to livelihoods). Interacting political, economic and social processes at different levels affect vulnerability and/or opportunities of migrants. The three-tier framework provides a platform from which to draw such an analysis.\\nFocus group discussions as illustrated in Table 4 indicate that inadequate water resources resulted in the loss of livestock due to diseases and starvation. This view is statistically represented by 21 per cent of all the responses given during focus group discussions. From the macro perspective, the lack of adequate water resources can be understood as denoting an array of ecological factors, which may either have direct or indirect impacts on individuals or households. Maystadt and Mueller (2012) suggest that environmental degradation and resource depletion arising from water shortages may play a contributing role in affecting population movement, often filtered through contexts of poverty, food deficiency, conflicts and inequity over land resources such as grazing pastures for cattle.\\nNatural resources have played a significant role in many violent conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa. In the context of the study informing this paper, focus group discussions indicated that inequalities in access and use of common grazing grasslands and water resources in many parts of Southern Province are rampant and a source of recurring conflict. A female participant in her late 50s who has settled in Mukonchi said:\\nEvery time my sons or husband went out to herd cattle when we were in Zongwe, 10 I was not sure if they would all come back in one piece. People used to fight over fields and dug-out wells to graze and water the animals. Those areas were battle zones and it was like the end of the world had come [. . .] Moving away was the most viable option for us.\\nIn another discussion, a man aged between 45 and 50 years old pointed out that, 'It is better for a man not to have a family, than not to have cattle'. The two observations suggest that livestock, particularly cattle, among the Tonga is an important resource: if it is threatened it can trigger different responses, in particular migration. It is important to note that cattle are symbolic of wealth, power and social status in the community (see Cligget, 2000). Individuals or households with large numbers of animals have greater access to and control of both natural resources (for example, land) and political power within the community.\\nThe above observation is supported by the theoretical assertion embedded in the macro perspective of population movement in which political, economic and cultural structures are believed to influence the decision to migrate. Political power in this case can be seen as a key factor in the control of resources such as natural assets (pastures and water resources). This means that households lacking the power to influence decision making with respect to resource use will be marginalised and migration then becomes an option for them.\\nIn addition to social status, cattle are used for different purposes such as payment of dowry, settling social conflicts within the community, transport and draught power for agricultural purposes. Livestock also contributes significantly to food supply and nutrition. Animals are a major source of food, particularly of high-quality protein, minerals, vitamins and micronutrients for the majority of the Tonga people. Animals also make indirect contributions to improving food security among the Tonga because cash incomes obtained from the sale of animals are regularly used to buy non-livestock food items and inputs to farming. Thus, the loss of cattle has serious implications for the welfare of many Tonga households and communities, and has the potential to trigger population movement in the direction of less stressful locations, where availability of water resources and vegetation can sustain cattle and other livestock upon which the Tonga people depend. Milimo et al. (2002) claim that the impacts of drought have been felt across the country in different ways, and are mostly related to declining livelihood security and increased poverty among rural populations. CEEPA (2006, p. 3) observes that, 'crop production in Southern Province has faced the negative impacts of extreme climate events, which are believed to be manifestations of long-term climate change'. These changes, notably in the form of reduced precipitation, could be argued to have contributed to fluctuations in maize production particularly during the 1990s. It is suggested in Figure 2 that maize production in 1992, 1995 and 2003 was severely affected due to insufficient rainfall. During these years, the incidence of poverty in southern Zambia is reported to have risen from 79 per cent in 1991 to 87 per cent in 1993, and from 76 per cent in 1995 to 80 per cent in 2004 (CSO, 2005).\\nThe difference in poverty levels between the first and second droughts are nine per cent and four per cent respectively, so it is plausible to argue that changes in precipitation affects agricultural productivity, and this has implications on food security of households and whole communities. Repeated food insecurities and rainfall variability can play a key role in influencing the decision of individuals and households either to migrate or to stay. A male participant aged between 40 and 50 years old who had migrated from Kalomo to Lunchu in 1994 stated: I retired from the police a few years ago and had to make a decision whether to remain in the land of my birth and lose everything I had worked for my entire working life. I had to make a choice whether to stay or chase the rain in the northern part of the country.\\nAnother participant referring to the impacts of repeated drought episodes expressed the view that:\\nPeople can always withstand bad harvests and bad rain, but when it happens so often, like it did in Kalomo, it is hard. Every year it happened, we became a bit weaker. Every year we became poorer. That was the big problem.\\nThe arguments suggest that vulnerability and/or the loss of various household assets due to a specific event, such as a drought, or a combination of extreme events, can influence the decision to migrate. This is because the loss of assets owing to changes in extreme climatic conditions can affect all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation and food systems stability. Individuals or households who lose their assets will have their livelihood options compromised, as their food production and distribution channels will be affected. This will then have a knock-on impact on household incomes and purchasing power, as well as market flows. The combined effects of such a situation would then be manifested in high poverty levels, compromised health and poor well-being.\\nReverting to the views expressed by the two research participants above, it is credible to argue that in times of stress, some individuals and households that are affected by drought and vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty are more likely to migrate to places of less stress, which offer alternative and secure livelihood options.\\nTable 5 is a summary of all the responses given by the respondents as influencing their decision to migrate.\\nThirty-one per cent of the responses from the 30 migrant households identified drought as the single most extreme weather condition that forced them to migrate. This is followed by problems associated with access to resources resulting in conflicts over natural resources such as pasture and land, which are statistically represented at 26 per cent of all 140 responses. It is important to note that poverty, resulting from reduced agricultural productivity as well as reduced income, was identified third and statistically represented at 19 per cent. Table 5 also shows that the decision of the 30 households to migrate was influenced by a combination of factors such as events associated with extreme weather conditions, difficulties in accessing natural resources, conflicts over resources, repeated episodes of loss of household incomes, persistent or chronic poverty and loss of livestock. Although drought episodes appear to have significantly influenced the decision for the 30 households to migrate to central Zambia, it should be noted that since 2000, Southern Province has also suffered repeated floods.\\nIn January 2008, for example, more than 13,000 families and households were displaced and evacuated in the Magoye (Mazabuka) area, when torrential rains flooded homes and destroyed farmlands (BBC, 2008). A male participant aged between 40 and 50 years old, who had migrated from Mazabuka in 2001 and settled in Mukonchi, stated during a focus group discussion that, 'in the 1990s we suffered from severe droughts [. . .] but nowadays flooding has been added to our problems. It looks like the Gods have become crazy'. Another male participant in his 50s, who migrated from Sinazongwe and settled in Lunchu said:\\nThe sudden shift from drought to floods left many of us helpless because our crops were destroyed. In addition to worsening our food insecurity, the floodwaters brought us diseases, destroyed houses, schools, hospitals, roads and even drowned our animals.\\nIt was revealed in many focus discussions that flooding, like drought, often resulted in crop failure due to crops being washed away, seeds failing to germinate or crops failing to reach maturity due to waterlogged soils. An added impact of flooding identified during the discussions with the respondents was that flooding had multiple impacts as it made it impossible for households to deploy informal safety nets or adaptive strategies. This is because flooding often destroys infrastructure such as roads and houses and renders the victims helpless-delivering relief to affected areas is extremely difficult. Kasali (2007) argues that as the frequency and intensity of floods increase in Zambia peasant farming has become less viable, thereby undermining the ability of the poor to come out of poverty and adapt to climate change. Consequently, they are left trapped in ever-deeper cycles of hunger, poverty and vulnerability.\\nAlthough many of the research participants identified extreme weather events associated to climate variability as triggers to their decision to migrate, it was important to determine the underlying factors or enablers that facilitated the movement for the 30 migrant households. Using the participatory research method of listing, participants were asked during focus group discussions to identify key enablers 11 for their movement. These are shown in Table 6. Table 6 shows that the main factor (68 per cent) facilitating the migrants' movement was having kinship ties in the immigration destinations. The second most important enabler (27 per cent) was having other social ties such as friendship or marriage with a native of Central Province.\\nA women aged between 40 and 50 years old, married and with nine children, pointed out during a focus discussion in Mukonchi that, 'we decided to move here because we had friends and family who had already settled here in the 1980s. They spoke to the local chief for us and we were given land and this is where we are now'. Another male participant in his late 40s, who originally migrated from Sinazongwe and who upon retirement from the civil service settled in Lunchu, stated:\\nAfter I retired, the next thing for me was farming. But farming in Sinazongwe is hard these days. But some old workmates and friends connected me to the traditional rulers here and I bought a piece of land here in Lunchu.\\nFrom the views expressed above, we can argue that although climate variability related events played a significant role in the decision to migrate by the 30 households, it is the social ties or connection to relatives and friends in the destination areas that facilitated or enabled them to relocate from Southern to Central Province. This development is consistent with the meso level of migration analysis in which social and symbolic ties among movers and groups of people are considered as resources available to them and facilitating the decision to migrate or not to. In this case, it could be argued that it is the social networks and kinship ties in the destination areas that played a key role in the decision of the 30 research households to migrate and settle in the two research sites.\\nFrom the views expressed by research participants above, it is important to note that changes in climatic conditions have an impact on households that are dependent on natural resources and rainfall for their livelihoods. Thus, the combined effects of extreme weather events such as repeated droughts and flooding can negatively affect a household's ability to obtain secure livelihoods. This is because changes in climatic conditions can adversely affect the limited assets that poor and vulnerable rural households have access to. This assertion presupposes the assumption that the decision for a household or individual to migrate is normally taken after the involved victims evaluate the assets available to them, and what the implications of extreme weather events are on them. When these resources are considered to be under threat and leading to compromised livelihoods or adaptive capacity of households and individuals, then migration can become one of the responses as a way of reducing their vulnerability and building their resilience against severe weather conditions.\\nIn the case of the empirical evidence discussed in this paper, it is plausible to argue that processes associated with extreme weather conditions such as reduced yields due to reduced precipitation, social conflicts arising from competition over natural resources and land utility, and food insecurities, are factors that can influence the decision to migrate. However, the decision to migrate is only realised when existing social ties in the emigration areas provide some form of security for the potential migrant. In a nutshell, therefore, it can be argued that it is the hope for a better life in the destination areas that seems to underlie a migrant's decision to relocate. In the case of the 30 household migrants studied in this paper, it is the perceived availability of reliable rainfall and fertile soils, coupled with the perceived potential for high agricultural output and financial returns in the destination areas that acted as ingredients motivating the decision to migrate from southern to central Zambia.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'Although there is increased interest in the relationship between climate change and migration, the connection is not yet clearly understood. This is due to the lack of empirical studies demonstrating the link between observed migratory patterns and changes in climatic conditions. Using field-based data this study has attempted to establish the complex relationship between extreme weather events and migration. Despite previous scepticism, the evidence in this paper suggests that migration is one of the common adapting strategies employed by farming households when subjected to the impacts of climate change. The insufficient availability of water, for example, affects not only agricultural productivity but also the survival of livestock, as well as other household assets important in adapting and building resilience against climate change.\\nMigration related to extreme weather is likely to become a new challenge to policymakers in the future. One recommendation is to promote policies that aim to make crops and livestock less sensitive and vulnerable to weather stresses and shocks. This may require encouraging farmers to grow more drought-resistant phenotype crops, practising crop and livestock species diversification, large investments in agricultural technology and sciences, educating farming communities on how to protect their assets against extreme weather conditions, and providing training and research for adaptation to local conditions. Furthermore, institutions mandated to take care of issues relating to climate change, food production systems and natural resource management must endeavour to create formal mechanisms that can mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change. These may include early warning systems and infrastructure development. Such policy responses would minimise the adverse effects of climate change on all sub-sectors of the economy and society.',\n",

       " 27: {'abstract': 'This paper describes the conceptual and practical development and testing of the Rainfalls Agent-Based Migration Model -Tanzania (RABMM-T). Drawing upon the literature on the process of developing and parameterizing a social simulation in the absence of spatio-temporal data, the paper outlines the translation of the conceptual framework into a working agent-based model. The possible impact of a change in local rainfall variability and mean upon household income, food production, and therefore the resilience and migration of members, is simulated to permit consideration of the possible impact of the artificial scenarios tested. In addition to the influence of changing rainfall, other non-rainfall scenarios are tested to explore the scale of the changes simulated. It is proposed that while a relatively clear impact of rainfall scenarios upon household resilience is simulated, the impact upon migration of household members is generally less clear. Furthermore, demographic and societal changes to the model are also seen to clearly contribute to the simulation outputs generated. The paper concludes that RABMM-T offers the first step in developing a potentially valuable resource for producing comparable migration forecasts that consider a range of contributory mechanisms. However, careful parameterization is required to ensure the quality and value of model outputs.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"The findings of each of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Assessment Reports draw upon global climate models that project future change on the basis of well-established physical principles. Between each assessment report, improvements have been made in developing the resolution, computational techniques and processes of parameterization used in model construction. From such advances Randall et al. (2007) were able conclude there was, considerable confidence that Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental and larger scales. Within that statement the elements that provide legitimacy to the claim are the degrees of confidence and credibility that may be conveyed. In this context 'confidence' refers to the quantification of model errors, themselves derived from how well the model performs in an ensemble of tests. From a high degree of confidence, credibility may be achieved through thorough and open model assessment and refers to how worthy of trust model results may be.\\nOur capacity to model and project changes to physical systems is of considerable value to governments and decision-makers tasked with facilitating mitigation and/or adaptation measures in response to future changes in climate. However, AOGCM outputs generally exist at some degree of separation from the human systems they impact. For credible estimates of future climate change to be of use to policy-makers, the separation between climate model outputs and their projected impact upon human systems must be addressed. However, forging a link between anticipated changes in a complex physical process such as precipitation and its impact upon human livelihoods at a scale of analysis useful to policy-makers remains a challenge. While the science of climate change has developed models that are based on well-established and detailed physical principles, the social scientific understanding of behavioural change lacks an equivalent degree of reliably re-applicable and re-scalable principles. Indeed, Perch-Nielsen (2004) found that the types of models used in climate and migration research were very different, to the extent that existing models could not be linked. Furthermore, Perch-Nielsen, Bättig and Imboden (2008) suggested that the connection between climate change and migration is by no means deterministic and aligned with a 'common sense' approach but depends upon numerous factors relating to both the people and the region in question.\\nThe readily apparent attributes of individuals (such as age, gender and marital status) are generally accepted within the modern literature as resulting in different degrees of resilience towards environmental change. The distribution of such attributes within a population is referred to within this paper as its evident heterogeneity. However, an inevitable outcome of a group of individuals inhabiting an environment within which interaction can occur is the formation of some sort of society. Such societies often take the form of complex adaptive systems as a result of the multiple nonlinear interactions that can occur between members and lead to complex global patterns with new properties. In addition to the evident heterogeneity of individuals, the more subtle influence of what this paper terms societal heterogeneity is therefore proposed to affect behaviour and potentially lead to otherwise unexpected, or emergent, outcomes. Due to the latent impact of societal heterogeneity upon the outcomes of behavioural decisions, this paper proposes that the explicit consideration of such factors is central to credible projections of how physical changes may affect human systems.\",\n",
       "  'Agent-based models': \"Described by Buchanan (2009) as the social science analogue of the computational simulations now routinely used elsewhere to explore complex nonlinear processes such as the global climate, ABMs may present a viable means of projecting the impact of physical changes upon human systems. A form of social simulation, an agentbased approach represents a computational technique for the study and modelling of social interactions and communications (Li, Mao, Zeng, & Wang, 2008). Alongside more traditional representations of evident heterogeneity, an ABM can include direct consideration of societal influences.\\nAlthough not widely used for simulating climate change impacts and adaptation, the potential contribution of ABMs to the field has been reported. Within recent analyses of developments in methodological approaches to linking climate change, environmental degradation and migration, both Piguet (2010) and McLeman (2012) cite the potential for ABMs to contribute to our understanding of the process. Within the climate-migration field, Kniveton, Smith, and Wood (2011) and Kniveton, Smith, and Black (2012) draw upon migration history and rainfall data and the social psychological theory of planned behaviour to develop an ABM that serves as a heuristic device to understand the characteristics of aggregate migration behaviour. Such an approach is described by Piguet (2012) as having the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the population displacements linked to climate change.\\nDespite the potential of Kniveton et al.'s agent-based approach, national-scale representative migration history data such as that used by the authors are both rare and difficult to collect. As such, the development of an alternative means of using an agent-based system to model the impact of changes in rainfall upon human migration is sought. This paper presents the development and testing of an ABM of livelihood stress and migration using survey data collected by the 'Where the Rain Falls' (hereinafter 'Rainfalls') (Warner et al., 2012) project in three villages of Same District, Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania.\",\n",
       "  'Livelihoods and migration in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania': 'A wealth of literature exists on the nature of the environment-migration nexus found across Africa. Jónsson (2010), for example, offers a review of the environmental factor in migration dynamics across 13 case studies in the Sahel region. Barrios, Bertinelli, and Strobl (2006) also explore the influence that climatic changes might have had in shaping the pattern of urbanization in sub-Saharan countries compared to the rest of the developing world. Numerous authors have also explored more in-depth environment-migration dynamics in more restricted geographical regions, such as the work of Henry, Schoumaker, and Beauchemin (2004) and Konseiga (2006) in Burkina Faso. However, few publications focus specifically on the environment and migration nexus in Tanzania.\\nIn this special issue, Afifi, Liwenga, and Kwezi (2013) provide an in-depth exploration of the nature of rainfallinduced crop failure, food insecurity and out-migration in Same, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania using the same sources of data used by this research. The authors identify a positive relationship between rainfall shortage and out-migration in the district with rainfall variability found to affect human mobility through livelihood/food insecurity. For a more in-depth discussion of the causal links at play between rainfall variability and human migration and a presentation of empirical data from the case study region, see Afifi, Liwenga, and Kwezi (2013).',\n",
       "  'Conceptual framing': \"While the initial contributions made by ABMs were theoretical and abstract, Janssen and Ostrom (2006) report an increasing drive to combine models with empirical methods, both quantitative and qualitative. The authors go on to suggest that dimensions of social influence, agent cognition and temporal dynamics are central to the development of an empirically informed ABM. Under the guidance of these three core considerations, the conceptual framework for the Rainfalls Agent-Based Migration Model -Tanzania (RABMM-T) is proposed. Figure 1 displays the conceptual framework developed by this research for translation into RABMM-T. The framework defines the level of abstraction adopted by the research in appropriately representing, without exhaustively reproducing, the true degree of complexity present in migration decisionmaking in the face of rainfall change.\\nWith four levels of analysis: external; structural/institutional; household and individual, the conceptual framework sets out the range of components included at each level of analysis. At the 'external' level the change in local rainfall variability and mean experienced by a location is input. This change is seen to affect a pentagon of 'drivers of migration' (Black, Bennet, Thomas, & Beddington, 2011), a number of subcomponents of which are identified for explicit inclusion in the model.\\nAt the household level, the foremost component is the 'vulnerability assessment', from which a household determines their resilience at time t. On the basis of the interdependencies identified by Afifi, Liwenga, and Kwezi (2013) as at play in the case study region, this assessment is framed by the degree of structural/institutional livelihood and food security their community is experiencing, their own characteristics (members, economically active members, dependency ratio and migration experience), and their income and food production (determined by attributes such as livestock, land, savings and the economic and migration activities of members). Regardless of the degree of resilience a household identifies, migration represents an opportunity to increase household livelihood and food security.\\nWithin the conceptual framework, migration is proposed to result from an individual decision mediated by the household. While an individual's migration decision is thus affected by their household's ability to invest in migration (itself affected by income and community characteristics) the propensity of an individual towards migration is driven by characteristics of age, gender, migration experience and the social network.\\nIn line with the three dimensions of an empirically informed ABM identified above, the conceptual framework incorporates social influence at multiple levels of analysis through the social and farm labour networks that allow the sharing of views on migration between peers and a means to distribute farm labour between members of the community. Processes of agent cognition are also included through the consideration of both household and individual levels of decision-making within the bounded rationality of human actors. Finally, a temporal dynamic is included as a result of the social feedback mechanisms that permit internal changes to the system over time. These feedbacks both adjust the social sphere within which decisions are being modelled to take place (by informing household members and peers of migration actions) and affect an individual's tendency towards migration in the future. As in a real-world system, the behaviour of one agent thus affects the later actions of others. Further details of the interactions and dependencies presented within the framework diagram may be found in Warner et al. (2012).\",\n",
       "  'Model parameterization': \"The conceptual framework sets out the level of detail and abstraction used to represent the complex phenomena under scrutiny. However, it is the process of parameterization that plays the largest part in controlling the confidence and credibility with which model results can be treated. Bonabeau (2002) suggests that finding the correct level of representation and complexity to appropriately model a system is an art more than a science. The more complicated a model, the more parameters and equations are required and, often, the more assumptions are needed to effectively bridge the divide between the true and simulated realities. Janssen and Ostrom (2006) distinguish between four approaches to use empirical information: case studies; stylized facts; role play games and laboratory experiments. Where large n survey data with high-quality observations is available (such as the case of Kniveton et al., 2011Kniveton et al., , 2012)), Janssen and Ostrom refer to the advantage of deriving statistical distributions and other stylized facts from the empirical data. Such data also provide a valuable resource for validation. However, in the absence of extensive spatiotemporal data a case study approach to model development may be pursued. In a case study context, the researcher has multiple but incomplete sources (census data, surveys, field observations and remotely sensed data) available to aid the development of different system components. Effectively used, such an approach can aid better understanding of the interactions between different components of a system and the impact of different scenarios. Gray (2010) notes that research on migration and the environment has been limited by both disciplinary boundaries and a lack of appropriate data sets. With longitudinal migration data being far from the norm, this research does not benefit from the sort of representative retrospective life history data that lends itself to a stylized fact approach to parameterization. However, the Rainfalls project survey and participatory rural appraisal activities conducted in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania (Liwenga, Kwezi, & Afifi, 2012) offer data that may contribute to a case study format. Although covering more than 1000 individuals from 165 randomly sampled households in three communities, the survey data collected in Tanzania are not representative at any larger scale and only provides comprehensive data on the attributes and actions of respondents at the time of data collection in 2012. In spite of the fact that such data provide a wealth of information that is useful for the parameterization of model variables at the start of a simulation, it fails to provide an adequate basis from which to quantify the degree of change in such variables given some form of external change over time. Because of these data limitations, the conceptual framework described above is designed to accommodate a less data-driven and more heuristic case study-based approach that uses survey data and recent literature to explore the role of rainfall in shaping the drivers of migration within the communities surveyed.\\nTo capture the unique situation captured by the Rainfalls research in the Tanzania case study study location, the process of parameterization begins with an analysis of the available data to explore significant relationships and dependencies within the system of interest. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the variables that contribute significantly to the prediction of migration being used by a household. Variables for which the resulting univariate regression coefficient was not significantly different from zero are listed in Table 1 and regression coefficient values displayed for both univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Whether or not a surveyed household had ever had migrants is seen to be significantly determined by numerous variables when tested using univariate models. These include variables relating to land ownership, demographic attributes and the economic activities undertaken by household members. However, when combined into a multivariate model, only the category of land owned by a household remains as a significant contributory variable. Used as a means to classify land areas reported as owned by survey respondents into discrete units, the land category variable represents the total land area owned by households. On the basis of the significant contribution of land category to the prediction of the use of migration by a household, Table 2 explores the variables that contribute significantly to the prediction of the category of land owned by a household.\\nPrediction of the category of land owned by a household is significantly contributed to by a series of variables at the level of a univariate analysis. These include variables relating to both household attributes and demography. However, when combined into a multivariate model only two of the original variables remain significant: the presence of household members that work on land not owned by the household, and the number of years the household have been living in the district.\\nOn the basis of the above analysis, if a purely statistically derived model of migration in the case study region were to be developed, the pertinent multivariate variables for inclusion could be narrowed down to a household's land category, the employment of members on others' land and the length of time they have inhabited the area. However, because of the heuristic and case study based approach adopted by this research, and the requirement to elucidate the temporal influence of rainfall upon migration tendencies, each of those components identified as significant at the univariate level is included in the heuristic reasoning of RABMM-T. As such, it is proposed that those variables listed in Tables 1 and2 contribute to the likelihood that a household surveyed by the Rainfalls Project in Tanzania will send migrants.\",\n",
       "  'External': 'Changes in local rainfall variability and mean at a monthly timescale provide the external change input to RABMM-T. To develop as clear a picture as possible of the relationship between rainfall, livelihoods and migration, a Monte Carlo method of repeated random sampling provides artificial scenarios of monthly change applied to historical data from Same Meteorological Station between 1950 and 2010. DRY and WET scenarios replicate those developed by Arndt, Farmer, Strzepek, and Thurlow (2012) for Tanzania to 2050. These represent -11.14% and +13.3% changes in mean rainfall, respectively, by 2050. In addition, two scenarios of more extreme change are used that do not represent any change anticipated to occur in the region but can assist in providing a clearer interpretation of modelled trends. Named EXTRDRY and EXTRWET, these scenarios represent double the changes simulated by DRY and WET with -22.28% and +26.6% changes in mean rainfall, respectively, by 2050. All four scenarios use the same degree of deviation around the mean as the historical data with their respective changes in mean achieved by 2050 through an equal annual proportional change.',\n",
       "  'Structural and institutional': 'Within the conceptual framework, the influence of rainfall upon livelihoods and migration is manifested through changes to labour markets (L) and food production (F ). These then influence the capacity of households to securely inhabit the region under current conditions. The relationship between rainfall and L or F is, in reality, highly complex. However, rather than attempt to recreate the true complexity and risk failing to represent the overall relationship, a more simplistic and transparent approach is adopted. The impact of rainfall upon L or F is thus pared down to a probability function that represents the approximate nature of the relationship in question. Assumptions made as to shape and scale of the influence of rainfall are thus clear and readily adjustable.\\nIf the model presented here were to be used in any sort of predictive capacity, the precise shape and scale of the influence of rainfall change upon L and F would be instrumental in ensuring confident and credible model outputs. In its current form RABMM-T can use one of two probability function shapes: non-scaled normal or sigmoid. With the range of influence of any rainfall value upon L or F ranging from zero (no available labour or food production) to one (maximum available labour and food production, restricted by the scale of the systems in question), a sigmoid probability function gives a standard rate of increase in L or F with increasing rainfall that tails off as it nears the maximum value. A non-scaled normal probability function meanwhile gives the same form of standard rate of increase with increasing rainfall up to the point at which one is reached. However, past this optimal rainfall value, an equivalent decrease in L or F is seen that represents the potentially negative influence of too much rainfall (Figure 2). The two probability functions described here apply a simple assumed relationship between L or F and rainfall. By making such clear assumptions no attempt is being made to explain the precise changes taking place. Instead the approximate natures of the complex interaction effects at play are being simply reproduced. Afifi, Liwenga, and Kwezi (2013) describe the Same District of Tanzania as a semi-arid zone characterized by a bimodal rainfall pattern made up of the Masika (long rains from March to May) and Vuli (short rains from October to December) rainy seasons. The nature of the rainfall patterns experienced provides the basis for interpretation of monthly rainfall into values that can be used within RABMM-T to affect L and F. While both the Masika (M ) and Vuli (V ) rainy seasons are proposed to affect agricultural yield, the wider labour market is proposed to be more continuously affected by rainfall as a rolling three-month control (R). From these variables, sigmoid or non-scaled normal probability functions may thus be calculated that scale the influence of a period of rainfall (R, M or V ) as multiplier values (r, m and v) between zero and one. The closer that r, m or v falls to one, the closer to optimal yield a household will, for example, be able to gain from agricultural land or livestock. Bardsley and Hugo (2010) suggest that communities affected by environmental change will reach thresholds beyond which migration will become central to an effective adaptation response. In this context, the shape and scale of the probability function used, and the point at which optimal and sub-optimal conditions are reached, is important to the outcomes of the model. On this basis, the probability function approach presented here is not intended as a fix all solution but as a means to explore the sensitivity of the modelled system to changes in the shape (non-scaled normal or sigmoid) and scale (point at which optimal yield is achieved) of the relationship between rainfall, livelihood/food security and migration. In such a way, rather than being based upon a known threshold (that is, as yet, unknown) future versions of RABMM-T may be used as a tool to investigate when a critical threshold within such a system may be neared and the steps that may be taken to manage or avoid such an occurrence.\\nUsing the investigative approach adopted here, in order to derive the shape of the non-scaled normal probability distribution of the impact of R, M or V upon householdlevel components, relevant historical (1950-2010) mean (µ) and variance (σ 2 ) values were required (Table 3). As no negative rainfall values can occur, the σ 2 used for each non-scaled normal equation was adjusted (divided by q) from the recorded value to provide a normal shape of distribution that output an approximately zero multiplier value at zero rainfall. Using µ and σ 2 adjusted by q, non-scaled normally distributed values of r, m and v (collectively n) were derived using Equation (1) (where\\nN represents R, M, V or M + V ). n = exp - -(N -m) 2 2s 2 . (1\\n)\\nIn Equation (1), μ controls the N value at which a multiplier of one is reached while σ 2 controls the shape of the normal distribution and thus the rate of transition between zero and one. For the equivalent sigmoid probability functions, the shape and scale of the transition between zero and one with increasing R, M or V (collectively S) are controlled by adjuster variables k (slope) and j (scale) to generate relevant values of r, m and v (collectively s). To replicate the rate of change produced by the corresponding non-scaled normal distribution, k and i are appropriately calibrated (Table 3) for each application of Equation ( 2)\\ns = 1 1 + exp -(k(S)+j) .\\n(2)\\nFigure 2 displays a graphical representation of the non-scaled normal and sigmoid r given R (three-month rolling rainfall) probability distributions for both May (highest three-month historical mean rainfall) and August (lowest three-month historical mean rainfall) as well as the relevant values for m + v given M + V (combined Masika and Vuli rainfall periods). Table 3 displays the μ, σ 2 , k and i adjuster variables calculated from historical data or subsequently calibrated for the non-scaled normal and sigmoid functions used monthly for R and annually for M, V and M + V.',\n",
       "  'Household': \"Within the RABMM conceptual framework, the resilience of a household in each of the Tanzanian villages under study (Ruvu Mferejini, Bangalala and Vudee) to the circumstances affecting them is determined by their income (i) and food production ( f ) each month. Contributing to i are crop yield for sale (c 1 ), livestock yield for sale (l 1 ), farm labouring opportunities taken on by household members (w) and migrant remittances (d ) (Equation (3)). Similarly, f is contributed to by crop yield for consumption (c 2 ) and livestock yield for consumption (l 2 ) (Equation ( 4))\\ni = c 1 + l 1 + w + d,(3)\\nf = c 2 + l 2 . (4\\n)\\nThe Rainfalls research conducted in Tanzania (Warner et al., 2012) included a household survey that provides a valuable resource for the construction of an ABM. Using household-level attributes gained from the survey data, the impact of changes in r, m and v upon the i and f of households can be parameterized. Household-level attributes (livestock, land, economic activity, savings and migrants) and characteristics (members, employment, dependency ratio and migration experience) are proposed to contribute to the resilience of a household to changes in their environment. Year 2012 values for these attributes and characteristics are taken from the survey data, providing a genuine basis from which changes to the circumstances of households may be simulated. However, to apply such changes in appropriate proportions, household attributes require scoring in terms of their relative value to households. In this instance the scoring system (Table 4) is derived from evidence contained within the Tanzania case study report (Liwenga et al., 2012) on the relative value of relevant items in Tanzanian Shillings. Depending upon the shape of impact of rainfall being simulated (non-scaled normal or sigmoid), the relevant n or s value is applied to the attributes of a household to determine their resilience at time t. Due to the different altitudes of the three villages studied, the rainy seasons that affect crop yields (c) differ. The irrigation systems in place in Ruvu Mferejini (lowland) lead Liwenga et al. (2012) to describe relative year-round availability of food. As such, the three-month rainfall measure, R, is used to determine the influence of rainfall upon crop yields in Ruvu Mferejini. While Liwenga et al. go on to describe the midland village of Bangalala as benefitting from both the Masika and Vuli seasons (M + V ), the highland village of Vudee is described as only benefitting from Vuli (V ). The relevant n or s derived values of r, m + v and v (ranging from zero to one depending upon rainfall at time t) are thus used to determine the impact of rainfall upon c (c 1 and c 2 ) using a standardized crop yield per acre value (y) and the area of land farmed by a household (p). In contrast to crop yields, livestock yield and the availability of farm labour are defined as being uniformly affected by R in all villages. Using the RABMM-T scoring system (Table 2), a household's livestock score (v) defines the maximum benefit available to the household which is then adjusted by r at time t.\\nBecause of the crucial social element involved in the distribution of farm labour, R is deemed not to be the only controlling factor. For a household to accept farm labouring opportunities, they must be made available by another household within the simulation. For the purposes of this test model, the farm labour system is restricted to the three villages in question. Households recorded within the survey data as having a history of offering labouring opportunities to others do so at a rate (w o ) governed by R. In order for the range of w o offered by the market system to be taken up by labourers, they must be informed of the opportunity.\\nWithin RABMM-T all households offering w o inform their social network of the availability of work. A household that has potentially economically active members available for work that receives communication as to the existence of opportunities will then be able to offer themselves as a labourer and take up employment for an allocated number of days (w t ). Rather than introduce some form of merit-based competition into the model, the proportion of total system w o is divided between appropriate labourers that have received communication as to the availability of employment (w s ) using an equal form of distribution between all appropriate individuals. Farm labouring activities (w) thus contribute to household income according the value of w t and the standard return for daily wage labour (x) (Equation ( 5))\\nw = w t x w s . (5\\n)\",\n",
       "  'Household vulnerability assessment': \"Following calculation of each household's i and f, their livelihood resilience at time t is determined. As well as i and f, the resilience of a household is affected by the household size (h) and the relative cost of consumption by one person (e), set at 0.083 per month. The resilience of a household is thus determined by their surplus (d ) post-consumption using Equation ( 6)\\nd = i + f h e . (6\\n)\\nThe average household size across those surveyed is six people. With e set at 0.083, and hypothesized to also represent the minimum non-food outgoings of a household, the average household is proposed to require a surplus each month of 0.5 to remain resilient. Following all outgoings each month, if a household has any remaining d, a standard savings rate of 60% (0.6 d ) is retained in order to bolster resilience in later months.\",\n",
       "  'Simulated household resilience': 'To test the influence of rainfall change upon household resilience classifications each month, the DRY, WET, EXTRDRY and EXTRWET rainfall scenarios are used as the external input to RABMM-T. Unless otherwise stated, demographic change is set at zero (equal birth and death) while the farm labour market is open across the system (all households communicate with all others). A base version of RABMM-T provides the foundation from which the resilience classifications output by the different scenarios can be compared. Within the base, scenario a standard value of 0.75 is consistently used as the multiplier values r, m+v and v. As a result L and F are consistently 75% of optimal, a level that provides a clear basis for 1 per month later comparison. Figure 3 displays the 10 member ensemble, 5-year moving averaged rate at which modelled households are classified as resilient under the range of nonscaled normal (N-) and sigmoid (S-) scenarios, normalized against the base scenario. Error bars show the complete envelope of changes simulated across the ensembles for the S-range of scenarios.\\nIn Figure 3 the EXTRWET and WET scenarios under both N-and S-rainfall structures generate a positive basenormalized rate of change. While N-EXTRWET produces the greatest positive change in resilient households, the second greatest comes from N-WET. Although also following this hierarchy, both S-EXTRWET and S-EXTRDRY produce generally smaller positive changes. In terms of drying, both S-EXTRDRY and N-EXTRDRY produce similarly negative normalized rates of change with lesser degrees simulated under S-DRY and N-DRY. By 2047, the highest positive change seen in Figure 3 is 0.034 (3.4%), while the negative changes peak at -0.054 (-5.4%). Although clear differences exist in the rate at which the 165 households remain resilient under the four artificial rainfall scenarios, deviations away from the base scenario are relatively small.\\nWhile still considering the household unit of analysis, the potential influences of both non-static demographic change and alterations to the household social network can be investigated within the structure of RABMM-T. In the case of demography, by applying UNPD (2010) medium variant crude birth and death rate forecasts to the model population, the influence of birth rates that consistently exceed death rates upon household resilience can be investigated. Changes to the social network of households, and the resultant impact upon the farm labour market, are more difficult to parameterize. The w achieved by a household (Equation ( 5)) is dependent upon the number of individuals seeking work (w s ) and whether the household has received notification of the availability of opportunities. In the base version of RABMM-T, households offering w o inform all other households across all villages, thereby creating an open, inclusive and fair market structure. However, a more realistic scenario might be that such sharing of opportunities is either restricted to the social network of labour offering households (the size of which can be changed) or to the relevant village. Figure 4 displays the base-normalized rate at which households are classified as resilient under the: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Population Division demographic scenario (UNDemog) with a standard inclusive network; static demographic scenario with each household networked with 10 others (Network10); static demography and 30 strong networks (Network30); static demography and 50 strong networks (Network50); and static demography with labour information sharing restricted to villages (RestrictionON).\\nAt the start of the simulation, the RestrictionON scenario is seen to represent the greatest negative change in household resilience classifications with almost 8% fewer resilient households than the base scenario. However, this negative value is simulated to gradually decrease over time and achieves a maximum positive change of 6% by 2043. In contrast, the number of resilient households simulated by UNDemog decreases over time to peak at -5% by 2045, likely as a result of the changing dependency ratio of fast-growing households. All three network size scenarios show a positive base-normalized change in resilient household numbers over time with very little deviation between Comparing the scales of change simulated for the scenarios displayed in Figures 3 and4 reveals that changes to the demographic and network state of the simulated households have a potentially more marked impact than the range of artificial rainfall scenarios tested. Furthermore, the degree of error shown in Figure 4 is relatively smaller than that seen in Figure 3.',\n",
       "  'Individual': \"Although the resilience of households to changes in their circumstances are of considerable interest, in the context of RABMM-T, such classifications are generated as a means to better understand the migration flows that represent the focus of this research. The migration decision is portrayed in the conceptual framework as an individual decision mediated by the household. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour approach adopted by Kniveton et al. (2011), each RABMM-T agent aged 14 and over within a household develops a migration propensity (P) on the basis of their attitude (A) towards migration and the influence of their peers (S). While S is indicative of the proportion of the individual's household and social network (set to a default of 20 peers) that have already migrated, A is derived using the potential migrant's age (a), gender (g) and the estimated relative likelihood of an individual with those characteristics migrating from their village (o). In the absence of comprehensive temporal migration data, this likelihood is calculated from the Rainfalls survey data using information relating to the first and last migration trips of respondents. Due to the limited data available for the cohort in each village, the range of attitudes used is approximated from the equation generated by a second-order polynomial trend line placed through the available migration data. Figure 5 displays the second-order polynomial trend line derived estimations of the likelihood of model individuals migrating according to their attributes of age, gender and home village.\\nIt can be clearly seen from Figure 5 that in all three study villages, males have a consistently greater maximum estimated likelihood of migrating, particularly in the village of Ruvu Mferejini. As well as revealing the age at which a villager's estimated migration propensity is greatest, Figure 5 also identifies the age at which the estimated likelihood of an individual migrating becomes zero. This is seen to range from approximately 64 years for males in Bangalala to 84 years for females in the same village. Although this approach to deriving and individual's A is constrained by the limited quantity of relevant migration data available to this research, it is used here as only as a comparative indicator of the relative likelihood of one individual undertaking migration compared to another. In all cases, both A and S values are calculated to be a value of 1 or lower and are combined evenly in this version of the model. However, their relative impacts can be adjusted using different values of b in Equation ( 7) to adjust the relative power of social influence hypothesized\\nP = b 1 A + b 2 S b 1 + b 2 . (7\\n)\\nIn addition to A and S components that contribute to an individual's P, the mediating influence of a household arises from its ability and willingness to invest in sending migrants. For a household to be able to invest in migration (in the order of ranked P values of members), the surplus (d ) remaining each month following subsistence must be greater than the cost of opportunistic migration (o 1 ), derived from Liwenga et al. (2012) and set at 1.5. For more than one individual from a household to migrate, d must be greater than the number of migrants multiplied by o 1 . Upon departure, o 1 is deducted from a household's monthly surplus. However, in later months, the absence of these individuals will contribute to household resilience through remittances (up to a monthly maximum of z, Table 2) and by reducing the number of members consuming resources at home. As well as needing to meet the cost of migration, a household's willingness to send migrants decreases with the departure of an individual in order to retain some economically active members at home and therefore maintain a buoyant dependency ratio.\\nWith the resilience threshold set at 0.5 and the cost of migration at 1.5, non-resilient households cannot, by definition, send opportunistic migrants. However, in acknowledgement of the potential for people to migrate under desperate circumstances at little or no cost, potential exists for non-resilient model households to send migrants. For such households, the cost of need-driven migration (o 2 ) is set at 0.25 with the same underlying process of migrant selection undertaken by ranking member P values. Using the DRY, WET, EXTRDRY and EXTRWET rainfall scenarios, the total numbers of migrants (from resilient and non-resilient households) are simulated and compared to those modelled under the base scenario. Figure 6 displays the 10 member ensemble, 5-year averaged base-normalized rate of total migration. The general trend of increased migration under wetting and decreased migration under drying seen in Figure 6 broadly reflects the pattern seen for household classifications in Figure 3. However, the scale of change in migrant numbers simulated is greater than that seen for household classifications with maximum positive and negative changes compared to the base scenario of +7.7% and -11.4%, more than double that simulated for household resilience classifications. Despite the greater extent of the change simulated, the results are less clear for migration with more overlap between the error bars of different scenarios leading to lower degrees of confidence in the precise change seen. Furthermore, while the Ninterpretation of scenarios led to consistently more extreme household classifications than the sigmoid alternatives, no such trend is replicated for migration. In order to unpack the relationship between migration and rainfall under RABMM-T, Figures 6 and7 display the base-normalized rate of change in migration from non-resilient and resilient households, respectively.\\nIn the case of migration from non-resilient households, almost all of the rainfall scenarios tested result in a simulated rate of migration greater than that of the base scenario. Only S-EXTRWET produces a rate of migration lower than that of the base. By 2047 the greatest positive changes in non-resilient migration are modelled as occurring under both EXTRDRY scenarios, likely due to the reductions in i and f that render more households non-resilient over time and lead to need-driven migration. Although the error bars in Figure 7 suggest a relatively low degree of confidence in the non-resilient migration trends modelled, the scale of change simulated is far greater than anything witnessed thus far with a maximum positive change of 48.5%. Although offering more clarity in terms of the contrasting influence of drying (leading to negative changes compared to the base) and wetting (leading to positive changes compared to the base), the scale of change in migration from resilient households in Figure 8 suggests a lesser influence from rainfall. Compared to the 48.5% increase in non-resilient migration described above, the maximum positive change in migration from resilient households peaks at 8.4% under S-EXTRWET. However, a greater negative change is seen in migration from resilient households, peaking at -15.2% under both S-EXTRDRY and N-EXTRDRY.\\nResults from RABMM-T therefore suggest that, under the range of artificial rainfall scenarios tested, total migration flows greater than those simulated under the base scenario result from wetting while lesser flows result from drying. It is clear from a direct comparison of Figures 6 and8 that the trend in total modelled migration  seen is driven by changes to migration flows from resilient households under each of the rainfall scenarios tested. Despite the proportional changes in migration from nonresilient households far exceeding those from resilient households, the relatively small actual numbers affected means that the situation of such households is lost at the higher level of analysis used for total migration. If found to replicate the true situation found in the case study region such a finding could have potentially important implications for decision-makers working in the region. However, as with the household classification results presented above, in order to place the influence of rainfall variability upon the total migration flows simulated into a  wider context, Figure 9 displays the influence of the nonrainfall scenarios tested upon total migration.\\nIn contrast to the equivalent household resilience classification shown in Figure 4, the total flow of migrants simulated under the RestrictionON scenario remains consistently just below the base scenario. As such, while more households were simulated as becoming resilient over time under the scenario, this did not have a marked impact upon the total migration flows modelled. In the case of the range of network scenarios, while the differences between the three scenarios are again small, the general trend of fewer total modelled migrants accords well with the increasing household resilience classifications simulated.\\nWithin Figure 9, the UNDemog scenario stands out. While household resilience was seen to decrease gradually over time in Figure 4, the total number of migrants simulated decreases markedly from around 2025 onwards, peaking at -41.5% in 2046. It is likely that such a phenomenon is modelled by RABMM-T as the population growth rate predicted by UNPD (2010) places more individuals within households, worsening their dependency ratio and leaving fewer households with the capacity to invest in either opportunistic or need-driven migration. Such an outcome is highly dependent upon the model structure used by RABMM-T which does not accommodate the creation of new households within the model system. As such, existing households grow with no capacity for separate self-supporting entities to be established. Although such a finding is thus limited and should be treated with appropriate caution until verified in the study location, it could indicate the power of demographic forces to influence household migration strategies in the future.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'Designed to simulate migration decision-making within the context of the livelihood resilience of households within the communities studied, RABMM-T offers a means of exploring the likely impacts of scenarios of future rainfall change. Base-normalized results generated by the model reveal that the four artificial rainfall scenarios tested have a consistent modelled impact upon both household resilience and total migration. While the proportional change in total migrant numbers is simulated to be greater than the equivalent change in household resilience classifications, less confidence can be placed in these results due to the greater degree of intra-model variation simulated by 10 member ensembles. Although unfortunate from the perspective of migration research, such a finding should be anticipated due to the greater level of complexity involved in replicating a human decision-making process. Indeed, it is this uncertainty that has led to the debate surrounding the existence of environmental migrants and the identification of agent-based modelling as a potential means to address the degree of complexity required in any future-oriented study.\\nBroadly speaking, RABMM-T simulates increased household resilience and increased total migration under scenarios of wetting and opposing results under scenarios of drying. However, analysis of the migration flows simulated from resilient and non-resilient households within the study communities reveals that migration modelled from non-resilient households does not follow this pattern with a clear increase in such migration simulated to occur, particularly under the scenario of extreme drying. Such findings suggest that the needs of those communities most vulnerable to the impacts of environmental change could be hidden from view under a study format that focuses only on total migration. If the existence of such a phenomenon were to be positively identified from further investigation led by simulation results such as these, the needs of the most vulnerable communities could be more appropriately identified and planned for.\\nDespite the focus of this research being to investigate the role of rainfall upon livelihoods and migration, a series of non-rainfall scenarios were also tested. Comparison of simulation outputs generated by both rainfall and non-rainfall scenarios reveals that alterations to the demographic and network state of model households have the potential to produce changes in both resilience classifications and migration flows that are equal to, and in some cases greater than, those simulated under changing rainfall. Such a finding highlights the importance of appropriately parameterizing the base conditions upon which external changes input to a model are required to act.\\nGiven the potential impact of the complex adaptive nature of societies upon modelling future migration, the potential explorative power of ABMs and the rarity of comprehensive spatio-temporal migration data with which to work, the process of model development described in this paper is intended as a viable alternative means of investigation. Although a case study approach to model development may limit the potential for findings to be extrapolated to different conditions and circumstances, this research provides a step in understanding the potential for later development of wider reaching models that may offer greater value to policy-makers. It is proposed that, although this work presents a technique that shows potential for future application as a tool to aid decision-makers, the quality of the data available to the research and the lack of an appropriate means of validation render it only as indicative of the potential that future applications may have.\\nIn order to generate model outputs of real value to policy-makers, adequate measures must be put in place to deal with the additional complexity introduced by non-rainfall parameters while carefully parameterizing and controlling all other variables. From the experience gained through completion of this research, it is clear that any form of data collection proposed to be undertaken to establish an empirical basis for future simulation efforts must appropriately address the numerous areas of uncertainty identified throughout the RABMM-T development process. Only by adequately understanding and quantifying the multiple and interconnected components that contribute to livelihoods and migration decision-making at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions may we construct models that offer the confidence and credibility required to be of practical assistance to decision-makers.'},\n",

In an EACH-FOR case study survey among 203 internal migrants from north-west Ghana, the vast majority mentioned environmental reasons for leaving their homes. 1 The respondents -setler farmers living in rural areas of Brong Ahafo Region in Central Ghana -said they decided to migrate because of scarcity of fertile land, unreliable rainfall, low crop yields and/or food security problems. A minority mentioned non-environmental reasons for migrating -lack of nonfarm income opportunities, family conlicts, witchcrat, catle thet and the desire to be free and independent.\\nThe survey indings indicate that this group of migrants indeed experienced a degree of environmental push.

Complex explanations of migration will be hard to distil from this type of interviews whereas the environment easily becomes part of local discourses on migration because farmers experience environmental conditions every day.\\nIf the environment is an important factor in explaining migration from the West African interior savanna to the moister forest and coastal zones, one could reasonably expect the propensity to migrate to be higher a) in environmentally less wellendowed areas and b) in times of increased environmental scarcity.

This research note reports findings from seven focus groups held in Ottawa-Gatineau, Canada, with recent migrants from the Horn of Africa and francophone sub-Saharan Africa, where the role of environment in migration decision-making was discussed. Participants stated that those most affected by environmental challenges in their home countries lack the financial wherewithal to migrate to Canada. Participants also suggested that internal rural-urban migration patterns generated by environmental challenges in their home countries underlay socioeconomic factors that contributed to their own migration. In other words, environment is a second-or third-order contributor in a complex chain of interactions in the migrant source country that may lead to long-distance international migration by skilled and educated urbanites. These findings have informed the scope and detail of a larger, ongoing empirical study of environmental influences on immigration to Canada.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"Popular and scholarly discussions of environmental influences on long-distance international migration have often been informed by the ''environmental refugee '' paradigm (El-Hinnawi 1985), which suggests that declining environmental quality and climate change is driving large numbers of people, especially in the Global South, into short-and long-distance migration (see Bates 2002;Gill 2010 for reviews). In a study that continues to be widely cited, Myers (2002) suggested there could be as many as 200 million environmental refugees worldwide by mid-century, most originating in less developed countries. Subsequent research has shown that the relationship between environmental processes and human migration behavior is complex and dynamic and does not necessarily unfold in the stimulus-response fashion the environmental refugee paradigm suggests. Instead, environmental migration is increasingly seen as one of a range of possible ways by which vulnerable populations adjust and adapt to environmental risks and hazards (Hunter 2005;Tacoli 2009;McLeman and Smit 2006), or as a means by which people seek to take advantage of environmental amenities and opportunities (Rappaport 2007;Gutmann and Field 2010).\\nResearchers are now seeking to understand better the processes by which environmental events and conditions interact with cultural, demographic, economic, institutional, political, and social forces to influence migration decisions and behavior (Black et al. 2011;Foresight 2011). Empirical studies have shown that these interactions can have a direct and obvious influence on migration, such as migration that emerges in the wake of natural hazard events (e.g., Schultz and Elliott 2013) or a subtle or indirect one, such as gradual changes in migration flows that emerge as a result of long-term land degradation caused by human activities (e.g., Henry et al. 2004;Shrestha and Bhandari 2007). Further, it is now recognized that a given environmental event or condition might lead to a variety of different types of migration responses and other forms of adaptation, as was seen, for example, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (Fussell et al. 2010;Groen and Polivka 2010). The available empirical evidence suggests that, in most instances, migration that occurs in response to environmental phenomena takes place internally within states or intra-regionally between contiguous countries, often following preexisting social networks (McLeman 2013). Examples include drought-related migration in dryland Africa and between Mexico and the USA (e.g., Barbier et al. 2009;Gray and Mueller 2012a;Nawrotzki et al. 2013), and flooding-related migration in Bangladesh and in Southeast Asia (e.g., Gray and Mueller 2012b;Dun 2011). Nonetheless, there continues to be a preoccupation in the popular media and among global policymakers with the potential for greater levels of international environmental migration, especially from the Global South. Calls are emerging from within the academy and from governments to use the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to create policies and programs to protect those who may be displaced or seek to migrate internationally because of climate change (Biermann and Boas 2012;Gibb and Ford 2012).\\nThis attention to long-distance climate-related migration reflects valid concerns that populations in less developed countries are especially vulnerable to the adverse future impacts of anthropogenic climate change and mean sea level rise (Fu ¨ssel 2010). Further, general equilibrium models developed by Marchiori and Schumacher (2011) suggest that environmentally related international migration could indeed rise as a result of climate change. However, an important challenge faced by scholars and policymakers alike is that empirical evidence on the influence of environment on long-distance international migration from the Global South to the Global North is quite limited and typically embedded within larger studies of environmental migration patterns from particular countries. Examples include studies of migration from Niger and Mali to Europe (Findley 1994;Afifi 2011), the Dominican Republic to the USA (Alscher 2011), Ecuador to the USA and Europe (Gray 2009(Gray , 2010)), and Honduras to the USA (Wrathall 2012). A much larger evidence base is required if we are to move beyond the normative prescriptions currently circulating of what ought to be done about future environmental migration and begin crafting evidence-based policy that focuses on most likely outcomes and needs.\\nIn our research, we are looking at this problem from the perspective of international environmental migration to Canada. There are past examples where environmental events overseas, such as earthquakes in Haiti (2010) and Italy (1976), and more recently super typhoons in the Philippines (2013), have prompted the Canadian government to facilitate the movement to Canada of people from affected areas, typically people with pre-established family connections to Canada. Events such as these are, however, exceptional in the broader context of Canadian immigration policy and the movement of migrants to Canada more generally. In 2012, Canada received approximately just over 600,000 legally documented migrants; of these, 257,000 entered to become permanent residents and 350,000 as temporary migrants (Citizenship and Immigration Canada 2012). The majority come from non-contiguous countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America (Fig. 1). Those arriving as permanent residents are selected through a variety of programs aimed at facilitating the migration to Canada of skilled labor migrants, international students, business people, and people with family ties to Canada. Temporary migrants consist primarily of labor migrants and international students (Fig. 2); some of these may subsequently apply for permanent status, although this is contingent on a number of regulatory provisions. Canada also offers permanent resident status to convention refugees, some of whom seek protection after making their own way to Canada, while others are assisted in relocating from abroad by relatives, benevolent organizations, or the Canadian government itself.\\nIt is not clear to what extent environmental events and conditions overseas might have an influence, if any, on this broader, heterogeneous mix of migrants to Canada. There is no straightforward or easy way to make such a determination from official records or statistics, primarily because, apart from exceptional cases such as the aforementioned examples of earthquakes and typhoon where the government has created special visa programs, potential migrants are not asked about possible environmental motivations. People who seek to migrate to Canada are required to provide a considerable amount of personal information, such as marital status, language skills, employment history, and personal net worth. 1 To obtain the necessary visa or permit, they are also typically asked to provide their reasons for seeking entry to Canada; however, these questions are usually tailored to the category in which the potential migrant seeks entry. For example, business Source: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/facts2012/permanent/08.asp. Note: It has been official Canadian government policy since the 1990s to set an annual target for legal permanent resident immigrants; this target has typically varied between 200,000 and 300,000 immigrants/year (for the year 2014), it is set for 240,000-265,000 (http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/notices/2013-11-01. asp) Fig. 2 Temporary migrants entering Canada in 2012, by category. Data source: http://www.cic.gc.ca/ english/resources/statistics/facts2012/temporary/03.asp. Note: People entering Canada as tourist/visitors are not counted. The number of temporary migrants entering Canada has grown steadily over the last decade. The number of temporary foreign workers grew from 102,000 in 2003 to 213,000 in 2012; the number of foreign students grew from 69,000 to 105,000 over the same period (2012 = the most recent year for which statistics are available at time of writing) immigrants will be asked about their entrepreneurial or investment intentions, family reunification applicants will be asked about their family ties to Canada, and skilled workers will be asked about their qualifications, past work experience, and the types of employment they will seek in Canada and in what cities. Environmental motivations do not figure into any of the categories through which migrants may legally seek entry to Canada, and so such information is rarely sought.\\nIt may be that, given the structure of Canada's immigration program, people who move internationally for environmental reasons are simply not represented within the flow of migrants to Canada. Alternatively, it may be that environmental factors are a consideration for some groups or individuals seeking entry to Canada, but that they are simply not being asked to identify them. A person for whom environmental factors are a motivating factor for seeking to leave the country of origin could, depending upon his or her family ties or skills set, qualify for legal migration to Canada under one of the various programs without ever being required to disclose that source of motivation. No systematic research has been done previously on this question, so we simply have not known if, let alone how, environmental factors overseas might influence directly or indirectly international migration to Canada. In 2012, we initiated a project to explore this question by working with large immigrant communities in several Canadian cities to find out whether environmental factors in their home countries had any influence on the decisions of their members to migrate to Canada. We began with a participatory research project involving members of several African migrant communities in Ottawa-Gatineau, in which we collaboratively discussed and documented the ways, directly or indirectly, environmental events and conditions in the countries of origin may (or may not) have influenced their migration decisions. Our project has since expanded to working with Haitian, Filipino, and Bangladeshi immigrants and will continue to develop over the next few years. Our key aims are to document whether environmental considerations play a role in migration to Canada and, in situations where they do, identify for which social groups or migrant categories are they most significant, the implications they may have for successful settlement and integration of those migrants, and any other considerations that may be relevant for Canadian migration policymakers. This research briefly reports especially noteworthy findings from the first stage of our project that will be of interest to other scholars in the field.\",\n",
       "  'Methodology': \"Given the exploratory nature of our project, we have been using qualitative methods to solicit observations on motivations for migration in terms of the environmental, economic, political, social, and cultural context of their countries of origin. We selected Ottawa-Gatineau for the first stage of our study because we are based here and have existing contacts within its large, diverse migrant population. We began by reaching out to local African communities because that continent is often cited in existing literature as being a significant location of environmentally related migration and, as can be seen from Fig. 1, Africa is a significant source of migrants to Canada across all categories (Morrissey 2014).\\nData collection was initiated by first holding open-ended interviews with representatives of African migrant settlement agencies, frontline social workers, and community leaders to explain the objectives of the project, to obtain their initial insights into the broader migration experiences within the communities, and to enlist their assistance in organizing focus groups with members of their respective communities. We fully disclosed the objectives of the project and our intention to ask questions about the possible influence of environment on migrant motivation. We emphasized that we presumed nothing and that it would be a perfectly acceptable research outcome should we be told that environmental factors are of no significance as motivations for migration within their respective communities. This same disclosure and instruction was made at the outset of each of the focus groups we subsequently organized. The focus groups were semi-structured, and a copy of the list of questions used is included in the Supplemental Materials for this research note.\\nWe held seven focus groups consisting of 47 migrants (24 men and 23 women) from the Horn of Africa (4 groups, 28 participants) and from francophone sub-Saharan Africa (3 groups, 19 participants) (Table 1). Participation was entirely voluntary, with participants being recruited by our initial contacts through their respective communities' social organizations. The only prerequisites for participation beyond willingness were that participants not be minors and that they had migrated to Canada within the last 10 years. Participants received a small honorarium of CAD$40 to compensate them for their time and travel.\\nOf the groups representing the Horn of Africa, one was a group of francophone migrants from Djibouti and the other three consisted of Somali migrants, mostly refugees. The Somali focus groups were conducted in the Somali language with the help of research assistants; the others were conducted in French. Overall, 23 focus group participants (48.9 %) had come to Canada as refugees (most of them government sponsored), 12 (23.4 %) as skilled workers, 10 (17 %) through family reunification, and two (4.2 %) said ''other'' or chose not to disclose their immigration category. All participants arrived in Canada as adults. The large majority (41 participants or 87.2 %) had been in the country for 5 years or less, with nineteen of them (40.4 %) being very recent arrivals-less than 2 years-and twenty-two (46.8 %) had been in Canada for a period of between 2 and 5 years. Two participants (4.2 %) had been in Canada for between 5 and 10 years; and four participants (8.5 %) chose not to disclose the date of their arrival. Many participants are highly educated; twenty-eight (59.5 %) have at least a postsecondary degree (Table 2). Eighteen participants (38.3 %) were between ages 18 and 34, twentyseven (57.4 %) were between ages 35 and 54, one (2.1 %) was 55 or older, and one (2.1 %) did not disclose the information.\\nThose participants who migrated to Canada as skilled workers said that their main motivation was economic and, to a lesser extent, social. Most of these had previously migrated to Europe (primarily France, Belgium, and Germany) to pursue postsecondary education. Upon completion of their degree, some went back to their country of origin but were unable to find appropriate employment and thus decided to migrate to Canada. Others filed their immigration application directly from Europe. They explained that it was difficult for international students to become permanent residents in Europe (especially in France) and that it was easier for them to immigrate to Canada. In addition, a number of participants believed Canada offered better employment and professional opportunities as well as a better quality of life for their families. For some, Canada's French-English bilingualism was also an attraction.\\nThe majority of participants who came as refugees were government sponsored 2 ; only a few were sponsored by their families, and one participant from Djibouti had arrived independently and asked for asylum. The Somali refugees came to Canada either directly from refugee camps in Somalia or via third countries, including Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, South Africa, Syria, and China. While they had little choice in selecting the country of destination, on reaching Canada most decided to settle in Ottawa either because they had preexisting contacts or because they had heard of its well-established Somali community. The other refugees came directly from their countries of origin (e.g., Burundi, Djibouti, DRC, Rwanda). Finally, most of the participants who arrived under the category of family reunification were sponsored by their spouses who had migrated before them; in only one instance was the sponsoring spouse born in Canada.\\nWhen asked to reflect upon environmental issues in their countries of origin, a considerable range of environmental challenges was described, which varied from one country to another. When further asked whether these environmental factors had any links directly or indirectly to their decisions to come to Canada, participants' answers varied, as did the importance they assigned to environmental factors relative to the primary reasons described above. Participants also reflected, often at some length, on how environmental factors influenced internal migration patterns within their home countries. The findings are summarized below.\\n2 Canadian permanent residents, citizens, and benevolent organizations (e.g., church groups) may offer to sponsor a refugee living abroad to be resettled in Canada; the refugee being sponsored is typically known to the sponsor, who undertakes to provide resettlement assistance to the refugee. The government of Canada also of its own accord resettles a certain number of UN Convention Refugees from abroad each year and provides resettlement assistance directly. This latter group is known as government-assisted refugees. Key findings: environmental influences on international migration versus internal migration Focus group participants generally believe that environmental factors influence population movements within their countries of origin. However, no participants cited environmental factors as having been the immediate or most important reason for their own personal decisions to migrate to Canada. Instead, participants within each group suggested, to the general agreement of others after discussion, that internal migration patterns generated by environmental pressures contributed to larger socioeconomic problems they faced in their home countries and that these in turn did influence indirectly their own migration. In other words, their collective view was that environmental factors in their home countries act as second-or thirdorder contributors to longer, complex chains of interactions that for some groups or individuals can lead to long-distance international migration to Canada.\\nTo begin with, participants were able to describe with considerable detail how environmental problems in their home countries, such as drought and land degradation (Table 3), create ongoing hardship for rural populations and help drive short-distance migration of the rural poor to urban centers. Several participants had directly experienced environmentally related migration within their home countries. A participant from Burkina Faso described how her father, who was a farmer, had in the past regularly migrated to Cote d'Ivoire during times of drought and eventually settled there permanently. Participants from Somalia, most of whom had lived in refugee camps, discussed livelihood strategies they had used in their home country to cope with drought and conflict (which often went hand-in-hand), such as selling off their livestock and participating in rural-to-urban migration. Other focus group participants who had not participated in environmental migration within their home countries described environmental challenges they believed to be linked to internal migration, such as Cameroonian participants who explained how falling water levels in Lake Chad are prompting fishermen to migrate elsewhere. Others described the actual or potential migration effects of floods, landslides, erosion, land degradation, and heat events (Table 3). Somali participants described deforestation in Somalia, how it is driven by the need for wood for cooking and charcoal production, and the competition with pastoralists who scour any remaining vegetation to feed their animals during droughts. Central African participants described deforestation there as being linked with the need for firewood, as well as with mining and commercial logging. Participants from areas where mining is common (e.g., Burundi, Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, DRC) reported people being directly displaced by mining companies, with mining-related land degradation and water pollution creating subsequent migration pressures. Participants from Burkina Faso said that export-oriented cotton production in that country contributes to land degradation and rural food insecurity, which in turn prompts internal migration.\\nParticipants were in many instances able to describe the particular patterns of migration that emerge in response to these environmental factors, such as increased participation in rural-urban, rural-rural, and urban-rural migration, depending on the circumstances. In some cases, migration is short-term or temporary; in others, it was described as being seasonal, cyclical, or permanent. For example, a participant from Burkina Faso described how Burkinabe farmers respond to drought with cyclical migrations to Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, while our Burundian participants explained that rural populations of Burundi cross into Rwanda to escape food scarcity during longer periods of drought. In Rwanda, we were told that farmers follow traditional migration pathways during times of drought, with some seeking to move permanently by buying land in the eastern parts of the country or by crossing into Tanzania. Deforestation, mining, and their associated environmental impacts in Cameroon and DRC contribute to the displacement of mostly rural populations who take refuge in neighboring rural areas.\\nParticipants were particularly knowledgeable about the movement of people between rural and urban areas in their home countries, typically describing it as being highly dynamic. We here again observed the distinctive nature of the Somali experience, as compared with that of other focus groups. Participants from Somalia described how herders who have lost their livestock due to drought often move to urban areas, even though urban food insecurity is already high given the heavy dependence on food produced in nearby rural areas. At the same time, the ongoing conflict in Somalia exacerbates scarcity of food, water, and energy in urban areas, producing a counterflow of urban out-migration to rural areas as urbanites seek to meet their basic needs. In Cameroon, drought sometimes pushes rural populations to migrate to cities, while in DRC, deforestation drives some rural populations to large cities such as Kinshasa. But participants explained that these unskilled rural migrants struggle to make a living in cities, where they must often work in the informal economy, and sometimes end up returning to rural areas.\\nParticipants from both the Horn of Africa and sub-Saharan countries discussed at length how urban ecological quality is declining in the source countries due to rapid, unplanned urban growth, and related challenges such as lack of housing, inadequate waste management infrastructure, growing air and water pollution, and in some cases, declining groundwater and disease outbreaks like cholera (Table 4). Participants see environmentally related out-migration from rural areas to cities as being an important contributor to this overall trend toward urban ecological decline. Participants also expressed concern that high rates of urban unemployment generate a degree of urban social unrest. Unskilled rural migrants were described as struggling with high unemployment in most of the source countries represented; participants also expressed concerns about educated urban youth who struggle to find work. All participants described the cities in their countries of origin as being relatively unhealthy, ecologically degraded, and potentially unsafe, and the combined effects provide a general stimulus to prompt educated and skilled urbanites such as themselves to seek professional opportunities and a better quality of life abroad.\",\n",
       "  'Common themes meriting further research': \"Despite the inherently qualitative nature of the focus group discussions and the subjective, personal experiences reflected therein, some common themes arose. A first is that environmental factors in the home country are not a proximate cause or influence on participants' decisions to migrate to Canada. Participants also did not know of other members of their communities in Ottawa-Gatineau having been motivated principally by environmental reasons to come to Canada. This is despite the fact that all focus group participants were able to list with ease a variety of environmental challenges faced in their home countries, could identify with some precision the types of people most affected by such challenges, and could describe how those environmental challenges affected population movements within their home countries or to contiguous ones. Participants' descriptions of environment migration dynamics in Africa are often consistent with empirical evidence in the many case studies reviewed by Morrissey (2014). However, it is clear that the people who become environmental migrants within Africa are generally not present in the stream of migrants coming to Ottawa-Gatineau from the African source countries represented here. The possible exception is that of Somalia, but even in that case, participants who had personal experience with environmental hardship and/or environmental migration in that country cited personal security, economic considerations, and family reunification as being their foremost motivations for migrating to Canada. This begs the question: If environmental migration is taking place in the source countries represented, why are environmental migrants not represented in international migration from those countries to the Ottawa-Gatineau region? Here, with the help of focus group participants, we can offer some suggestions. A starting point is the structure of Canada's immigration program, which facilitates the movement of skilled workers (where the skills require considerable investment in formal education and training) and people with family connections to Canada. Would-be migrants without a Canadian family member to sponsor them must be of independent financial means. The types of people most disproportionately affected by environmental changes described in the focus groups-agricultural workers, fishers, laborers in primary resource sectors, and so forth-would not qualify for migration to Canada in the absence of a family sponsorship.\\nThe experiences of participants from Somalia, most of whom sought permanent residence as refugees, differed from participants from other groups, but even here our Somali participants typically had Canadian relatives or connections to the Somali-Canadian community prior to migrating to Canada. It is likely not coincidental that participants in the Somali focus group were much more likely to have had a personal, firsthand experience with environmental hardship and/or environmentally related migration as compared with participants in the other focus groups, who were primarily skilled migrants from less conflict-torn urban centers. This suggests our future research must examine more closely the experiences of people coming to Canada within the refugee movement.\\nThis does not mean that environmental factors have had no influence whatsoever on the circumstances that have led non-Somali groups to migrate to Canada. Participants suggest there is an indirect connection between internal migration processes in these source countries and international migration from them. Within the source countries, seasonal dryness and drought combine with ecological decline resulting from human activities to become important drivers of internal population flows between rural and urban areas. The consequent influx of rural migrants into urban centers contributes to urban ecological decline, food insecurity, and socioeconomic instability. According to our participants, these latter phenomena become additional considerations for educated and skilled middle-class urbanites who might already be contemplating migration to an international destination like Canada for economic or family reasons. This suggests there is a quality-of-life consideration being made in addition to the income differentials between migration source countries and potential destinations that have been suggested elsewhere as being key drivers of international environmental migration from less developed countries (Lilleør and van den Broeck 2011). The overall dynamic described in our focus groups is shown in simplified fashion in Fig. 3.\\nFor Somali participants, the linkages between environment, conflict, and insecure access to food and basic resources are much more pronounced than participants from the other countries. People in Somalia who suffer from these ongoing problems simply do not have access to Canada's immigration system unless they are fortunate enough to have a close family member or other potential sponsor already established there. This structural barrier is not unique to Somalia, however. The people described in our focus groups as being most directly susceptible to environmental displacement in African countries-typically the poor, rural, and/or marginalized-would not qualify for independent admission to Canada. Their limited financial resources limit their migration possibilities to internal and/or intraregional destinations. By contrast, members of the educated urban elite who are not directly affected by environmental factors do have the ability to seek admission to Canada, should they so choose. Those represented in our focus groups suggest that Fig. 3 Influence of environmental factors in source countries on international migration causality, as described by focus group participants rapidly growing urban populations and declining urban ecological conditionswhich they (rightly or wrongly) ascribe at least in part to influxes of internal environmental migrants-are a consideration for the would-be international migrant and are likely to grow in significance. This subject stands out as warranting greater research attention given its relative absence in the empirical literature and given the scale of the urban ecological and demographic challenges facing African cities in coming years described by African researchers such as Crush and Frayne (2011).\\nOur participants held various views on the relative significance of environmental factors versus social, economic, and political ones in shaping migration. Some saw environmental factors as central to the challenges that populations in their countries of origin face and thus to migration. More participants, however, suggested that political instability, weak governance, endemic poverty, lack of economic alternatives, and lack of infrastructure were at the root of environmental problems in the first place-and so these were seen as being the main drivers of migration. In all cases, participants clearly see the environment not as an independent or exogenous force, but as being intertwined with non-environmental factors in migration causality. Our findings support the continued development of approaches that treat environmental migration as an outcome of dynamic interactions between human and environmental systems (as in Black et al. 2011). In particular, our findings point to the need to examine more carefully how structural barriers in recipient countries of international migration, such as Canada, constrain the adaptive migration options of those most greatly exposed to environmental risks. In short, there remains much to learn about environmental influences on South-North migration patterns, reinforcing the need for considerably more empirical research on the subject.\"}}"
