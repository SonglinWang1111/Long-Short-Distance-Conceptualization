    "This experiment employs LLMs to extract and summarize geographic information from unstructured, empirical literature on migration studies, especially climate migration (i.e., climate change or environmental events related human migration). The core task here is to simply, automatically classify the type of human migration discussed in each paper into 2 qualitative categories: long-distance human migration or short-distance human migration. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this task differs from more straightforward NER, but relatively comprehensive. The conceptualization of migration type is rarely explicitly addressed by the context, but should be inferred by LLMs based on more implicit natural language descriptions. According to the literature, apart from NER-like extraction, such information should sometimes be inferred from distance between place names, from difficulties induced by border crossing, from other synonyms or semantically similar words like 'internal human migration' and 'international human migration' and so on and so forth. It's natually that such conceptualization can't be identical when different background applies, however, studying that is not useless, since it not only helps data analysis, ontology engineering and information retrieval, but also influence decision making and policy making regarding human migration.
